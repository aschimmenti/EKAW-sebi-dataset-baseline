CONTEXT:
Document abstract: {document_abstract} 
Entity: {entity}, {entity_context} 
TEXT INPUT: 
{text} 

Extract the following information step by step:
Is {entity} mentioned as having an opinion about the given document? First, determine if {entity} is reported in the given text. Then, check if {entity}, directly or indirectly, has been credited or says something about the document. Return 'True' or 'False'. If False, you can use null in all the following questions. 
Does {entity} think the document is authentic, a forgery, or are they only suspicious of its authenticity? First, identify any clue from the evaluative statements that might justify this choice. Then, return 'authentic', 'forgery', 'suspicious' or 'null'. 
Given the previous answer, does {entity} point out any evidence or feature that might justify the previous choice? Look for specific characteristics or evidence provided by {entity} to support their opinion, and choose one or more of the the following features: authentication marks / chronology and dating / content / document provenance / format (spacing, signs) /  handwriting  / historical context / illustration or other graphical device /  indentation / ink  / inter-punctuation / interpolations / legal formulas  / list of witnesses /  material support / metre and style / original document  / orthography / sigillum or seal.
Return the feature(s) with one or more of the following evaluations. 
- reliability: is the analysed feature trustworthy? (return: True/False)
- completeness: is the document complete of all its parts or elements? i.e., is it partially broken, in a bad state... (return:True/False)
- consistency: is the analysed feature agreeing with other associated features? (return: True/False)
- presence: some feature may be reported as present or absent, for example if the document provenance is not reliable, or if there is no original document. (return: True/False)
- veridicality: is the analysed feature truthful and accurate? (return: True/False)

Does {entity} provide a reason for why the document might have been forged? Check if the entity mentions any motives or circumstances that might explain a forgery. Return only terms or 'null'. 
Does {entity} attribute a possible author of the document/forgery? See if the entity identifies any individuals or groups as the potential author of the document (or of the forgery). Return only names, terms or 'null'. 
Does {entity} attribute a possible date for the creation/forgery? Look for any dates or periods when {entity} thinks the forgery might have occurred. Return only a date or 'null'. 
Does {entity} attribute a possible location of the creation/forgery? Identify if {entity} mentions any specific places where the forgery might have taken place. Return only a place or 'null'. 
Did {entity} study the document from a specific perspective? Determine if {entity} analyzed the document using a particular academic or methodological approach. Use one or more of the following terms or 'null':
Scientific analysis, Historical analysis, Philologic analysis, Diplomatic analysis, Paleographic analysis, Literary analysis. Before choosing a term, reason if the opinion might align with one of these terms.

Document abstract: Posthumous Diary (Diario postumo) is a series of poems attributed to the Italian poet Eugenio Montale which first appeared in full in 1996, after the poet's death. 
Entity: Federico Condello (Verona, 1973), works as classical philologist, university professor
TEXT INPUT: 
The controversy was reignited in 2014 with the publication of the book 'I filologi e gli angeli. Ãˆ di Eugenio Montale il Diario postumo?' by Federico Condello, which thoroughly analyzes the editorial history of the Diario, highlighting various inconsistencies. 'Montale e pseudo Montale. Autopsia del 'Diario postumo'. This volume includes numerous linguistic, metrical, and stylistic analyses, as well as some documentary investigations that, referring to the materials used (primarily facsimiles of the autographed manuscripts of the Diario) or to letters and notes preserved in the Scheiwiller Archive (now at the Apice Center of the University of Milan), allow for the reconstruction of certain periods of Annalisa Cima's activity, especially between 1981 and 1986. From these documents, no elements emerge in favor of the thesis of authenticity, while some data conflict with all the reconstructions proposed in the various statements of the Diario's dedicatee.

CONTEXT:
Document Abstract: The Tulli Papyrus is an apocryphal document in the form of an ancient papyrus written in hieratic script, discovered in Egypt in 1934, which purportedly contains descriptions of strange sightings of lights and objects in the sky. After being cited for decades as a "mysterious" and "anachronistic" object, in 2006, following analysis by enthusiasts and scholars from an online community, it was definitively established to be a fake, composed of phrases taken from Alan Gardiner's Egyptian Grammar, a well-known grammar of the Egyptian language.
Entity: Franco Brussino, egyptologist, linguist
TEXT INPUT: The papyrus text was subjected to analysis in April 2006 by enthusiasts and scholars: through an Italian online community (egittologia.net), the "case" began to be studied starting from a new translation of the text, derived from the image published by De Rachewiltz. During the translation, Franco Brussino, an expert in Egyptology, noticed a few inconsistencies: first, the similarity between some passages of the papyrus and phrases from known texts. The text also lacked any official marking that would be required from the bureaucratic source. Also, through simple radiocarbon dating, the papyrus could not have bee written before 1880, and the ink use was probably industrially produced. Then, by looking at the sources regarding the papyrus's finding, he noticed a lot of inchoerencies in the archeological report. Bibliographic research led to the discovery of the same phrases from the incriminated papyrus in a fundamental text on the Egyptian language, Sir Alan H. Gardiner's Egyptian Grammar, published in 1927 and therefore preceding the discovery of the papyrus.

Example 3:
CONTEXT:
Document Abstract: The Magna Carta Redux is a purported medieval charter that claims to be a lost extension of the original Magna Carta, discovered in the early 20th century by some members of the Parliament in the House of Commons Library. This document allegedly provides additional rights and privileges to the barons of England and extends additional taxation to commoners. It was supposedly written in 1217, two years after the original Magna Carta. 
Entity: Dr. Emily Richards (born 1980), historian and manuscript specialist
TEXT INPUT: In her 2020 paper "The Forgery of the Magna Carta Redux," Dr. Emily Richards presents a detailed critique of the document's authenticity. Richards points to several discrepancies in the handwriting, composition, and legal formulas used. No illumination or mark was to be found in the manuscript, which would be rare for such an important document. She highlights that the handwriting does not match any known samples from the 13th century, and the ink contains chemical compounds that were not available until the 19th century. The manuscript was also exceptionally well-preserved for the time of its finding. Additionally, no other document from that period ever mentioned or reported any of the laws stated in the Redux charter. Richards concludes that the manuscript was probably an attempt by some members of Parliament to reignite the debate around the hereditary privileges of England's nobility.

Example 4:
CONTEXT:
Document Abstract: The Flower Manuscript is an allegedly medieval Polish manuscript that describes the various types of flowers sold in the Krakow market between 990 and 1100. The document has often been considered a forgery, suspected to be a publicity stunt orchestrated to attract tourists and boost the local economy.

Entity: Jan Tokarczuk (born 1945), philologist 

TEXT INPUT:
After intial doubts, in a local newspaper article, "The Forgery of the Flower Manuscript," Dupa presents a detailed critique of the document's authenticity. Dupa concludes that the manuscript was probably an attempt by local merchants to create a historical artifact that would attract tourists and boost sales in the Krakow market. He also reported some linguistic inconsistencies. Valuable contributions towards this were given by J. Tokarczuk.

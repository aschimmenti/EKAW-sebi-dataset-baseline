            "Document description": "The Ashtiname of Muhammad, also known as the Covenant or Testament (Testamentum) of Muhammad, is a charter or writ granting protection and other privileges to the followers of Jesus, given to the Christian monks of Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula. Ascribed to Ali (scribe), and Muhammad (commissioner) in the 623 CE, it is sealed with an imprint representing Muhammad's hand.[1]\n\nĀshtīnāmeh (IPA: [ɒʃtinɒme]) [آشتی نامه] is a Persian phrase meaning \"Letter of Reconciliation\", a term for a treaty or covenant.[2]",
            "Document claims": "The document is generally accepted as authentic by modern and ancient scholars, including Franciscus Quaresmius, Balthasar de Monconys, and Kara Mustafa Pasha.[7][8] John Andrew Morrow has also confirmed the authenticity of the document, pointing out that the document is replicated verbatim across numerous Islamic sources, including more than a thousand years of Caliphs and Sultans.[9][10][11] Since the 19th century, several aspects of the Ashtiname, notably the list of witnesses, have been questioned by some scholars.[12] There are similarities to other documents granted to other religious communities in the Near East. One example is Muhammad's alleged letter to the Christians of Najran, which first came to light in 878 in a monastery in Iraq and whose text is preserved in the Chronicle of Seert.[1]\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Bernhard Moritz, in his seminal work, claimed that: \"The impossibility of finding this document to be authentic is clearly evident. The date, style and content all prove the inauthenticity.\"[13] Amidu Sanni points out that there are no existent codices, Islamic or otherwise, which predate the 16th century,[14] and Dr Mubasher Hussain has questioned the authenticity of the document on the basis of the fact it contains an impression of a hand which it is claimed belongs to that of Muhammad, but which, rather than showing the inside of the hand as might be expected, \"surprisingly shows the outer side of the hand, which is possible only if it is taken using a camera!\" Furthermore, he claims that \"many language expressions used in this covenant\" are dissimilar \"to those of the Prophetic expressions preserved in the authentic hadith collections.\"[15]"

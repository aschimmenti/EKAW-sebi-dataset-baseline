You are an expert Named Entity Recognition (NER), specialised in selecting entities who are reported as having said something, therefore a COMMENTATOR.
Your task is to accept Text as input and extract entities if and only if they are described and implied as having given an opinion. 
Entities must have one of the following labels: {{ ', '.join(labels) }}. Make sure to return entities with their full name in case they are referred to multiple times.
If a span is not an entity label it: `==NONE==`.
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- if description -%}
{# whitespace #}
{{ description }}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endif -%}
{%- if label_definitions -%}
Below is an additional definition to help aid you in what entities you must extract.
Assume these definitions are written by an expert and follow them closely.
{# whitespace #}
{%- for label, definition in label_definitions.items() -%}
{{ label }}: {{ definition }}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endfor -%}
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endif -%}
{%- if prompt_examples -%}
Q: Given the paragraph below, identify a list of entities, and for each entry explain why it is or not they are giving an opinion:
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- for example in prompt_examples -%}
Paragraph: {{ example.text }}
Answer:
{# whitespace #}
{%- for span in example.spans -%}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ span.to_str() }}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endfor -%}
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endfor -%}
{%- else -%}
{# whitespace #}
Here is an example of the output format for a paragraph.
Do not output anything besides entities in this output format.
Output entities in the order they occur in the input paragraph regardless of label.

Q: Given the paragraph below, identify a list of entities that are giving an opinion, and for each entry explain why it is or is not an to be considered an entity who is giving an opinion:
Paragraph: A. V. Route puts forward a number of arguments against the Diaries of Ludwig Van. Historian Mark Lalli regards the Diaries as indisputable in content, while rejecting the second copy of them as a forgery. Panorama later made a documentary with Alberto Angela about the discovery. The Diaries indeed reproduce the arguments that will be later be public in one of Ludwig speeches.[10]\n\nThat the Diaries are a falsification of a genuine letter, now lost, is the final opinion given by textual scholar Anne Duggan of King's College, London. Route's remaining concern disappeared after studying Duggan's work. 
Answer:
1. A. V. Route: COMMENTATOR | he/she is 'putting forward arguments'
2. Ludwig Van: ==NONE== | because it is only mentioned as an entity
3. Diaries: ==NONE== | because it is only the name of a document 
4. Mark Lalli: COMMENTATOR | because it's the name of an historian who 'regards the Diaries as [...]'
5. Panorama: ==NONE== | it's a newspaper, but in this context they are not expressing an opinion
6. Alberto Angela: ==NONE== | only mentioned, not giving an opinion
7. Ludwig: ==NONE== | only mentioned
8. Anne Duggan: COMMENTATOR | because her opinion is reported
9. King's College: ==NONE== | it's not giving an opinion, only mentioned
10. Route: ==NONE== | he's referred to before with the most full name in the text (A.V.Route)
11. Duggan: ==NONE== | she's referred to before with the most full name (Anne Duggan)

        "Document description": "The Ashtiname of Muhammad, also known as the Covenant or Testament (Testamentum) of Muhammad, is a charter or writ granting protection and other privileges to the followers of Jesus, given to the Christian monks of Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula. Ascribed to Ali (scribe), and Muhammad (commissioner) in the 623 CE, it is sealed with an imprint representing Muhammad's hand.[1]\n\nĀshtīnāmeh (IPA: [ɒʃtinɒme]) [آشتی نامه] is a Persian phrase meaning \"Letter of Reconciliation\", a term for a treaty or covenant.[2]",
        "Document claims": "The document is generally accepted as authentic by modern and ancient scholars, including Franciscus Quaresmius, Balthasar de Monconys, and Kara Mustafa Pasha.[7][8] John Andrew Morrow has also confirmed the authenticity of the document, pointing out that the document is replicated verbatim across numerous Islamic sources, including more than a thousand years of Caliphs and Sultans.[9][10][11] Since the 19th century, several aspects of the Ashtiname, notably the list of witnesses, have been questioned by some scholars.[12] There are similarities to other documents granted to other religious communities in the Near East. One example is Muhammad's alleged letter to the Christians of Najran, which first came to light in 878 in a monastery in Iraq and whose text is preserved in the Chronicle of Seert.[1]\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Bernhard Moritz, in his seminal work, claimed that: \"The impossibility of finding this document to be authentic is clearly evident. The date, style and content all prove the inauthenticity.\"[13] Amidu Sanni points out that there are no existent codices, Islamic or otherwise, which predate the 16th century,[14] and Dr Mubasher Hussain has questioned the authenticity of the document on the basis of the fact it contains an impression of a hand which it is claimed belongs to that of Muhammad, but which, rather than showing the inside of the hand as might be expected, \"surprisingly shows the outer side of the hand, which is possible only if it is taken using a camera!\" Furthermore, he claims that \"many language expressions used in this covenant\" are dissimilar \"to those of the Prophetic expressions preserved in the authentic hadith collections.\"[15]",

        "Document description": "The Golden Charter of Bern (also: Golden Bull, in German: Goldene Handfeste or Berner Handfeste) is a medieval charter purporting to have been issued by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. It establishes the town privileges of Bern (now the capital of Switzerland), making it an Imperial Free City and, effectively, an independent state. The charter is dated to 1218, but is now believed by most scholars to be a Bernese forgery from the middle of the 13th century.[1]",
        "Document claims": "The charter's 54 articles provided for extensive privileges, including the free election of the Schultheiss (i.e., mayor) and the right to autonomously legislate. It also provided for the establishment of an Imperial Mint, which was established in 1228 at the latest, to coin Berner Pfennige. These rights were formally confirmed by King Rudolf I in 1274, and the issue of the charter's authenticity thus made moot. The charter is called \"golden\" due to its impressive (and undoubtedly authentic) golden bull, or seal. Its face shows Frederick on the throne with his Emperor's regalia, circumscribed \"Frederick, by the Grace of God Roman King, ever increasing the Empire, King of Sicily.\"\n\nThe issue of whether the charter — regarded as Bern's founding document for centuries — is authentic has been contentious among historians since the 1860s. Modern researchers now seem to agree that it is a forgery done on behalf of Bern's government during the middle of the 13th century, done to establish in writing the rights the city had in practice seized decades previously. They point out that the exceptional liberties granted by the charter were very atypical for the time, and that the writing seems to match that of one writer in the Frienisberg monastery. Monasteries, at that time, were masters of the pia fraus, the \"pious fraud\" of falsifying documents to match a dead benefactor's supposed intent. On the other hand, X-ray analysis in 2002 did not reveal any indication that (as had been assumed) the authentic bull had been removed from an authentic document and then re-affixed to the Bernese charter.",

        "Document description": "The Marriage Charter of Empress Theophanu (State Archives of Wolfenbüttel, 6 Urk 11) is the dower document for the Byzantine princess Theophanu. Written in Latin, the document was created after the marriage of Theophanu to Emperor Otto II in 972, which made her the empress of the Holy Roman Empire. The document was prepared by Otto II and exemplifies an instance of political and cultural contact between the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire.It serves as an example of Ottonian Renaissance art, and the calligraphy of the manuscript has led it to be regarded as one of the most beautiful diplomatic documents of the Middle Ages. In 2005, the document was proposed for inclusion in the Memory of the World Register, but was not included.[1]",
        "Document claims": "The document is a 144.5 by 39.5 cm (56.9 by 15.6 in) scroll consisting of three pieces of parchment glued together and rolled,[14] and is believed to have been created in the Fulda monastery.[15][16] A scientific study of the purple parchment took place in Munich in 1966, which showed that minium (red lead) and madder were used for staining the document, indicating that it was created in the Holy Roman Empire, rather than in the Byzantine Empire,[15][17] where the Murex shell for making Tyrian purple was tightly controlled. This document is one of the oldest surviving examples of madder being used in the Middle Ages.[17][18] The purple background was made from Byzantine silk woven with fourteen circular medallions and two half medallions. The medallions contain representations of animals fighting, inspired by Near Eastern art.[19]\n\nThe writing field is surrounded by a narrow gold trim decorated with blue and white acanthus leaves.[15] The top edge is decorated with animals and vegetation, along with medallions containing half-figures, such as Jesus flanked by Mary and John the Baptist with four Evangelists. Between the medallions at the top are six pairs of animals.[15][20] It was the first marriage document to be illuminated.[21]\n\nThe text is written in gold in Carolingian minuscule calligraphy, and the gold ink was obtained from an alloy of silver and gold leaf.[22] A few lines or words stand out as they are written in rustic capitals.[23][24] Over time, the parchment has slightly warped, and there is a fold in the middle of the document. It is presented in a permanent exhibition of the State Archives of Lower Saxony in a dimly lit room.[15][25]\n\nImperial purple was a colour reserved for emperors, kings and bishops, and purple parchment was rarely used for writing.[26] This document is regarded as one of the most luxurious and beautiful examples of the use of purple parchment.[27]\n\nThe authenticity of this document remains a matter of debate.[16] Hans K. Schulze and Hans Goetting believe that the document was presented by Otto II at their wedding feast, and then given to Theophanu.[28] Walter Deeters (1972) says that the separations in the text act as reading aids, showing that the document was intended to be read.[29] Diplomats Theodor von Sickel and Carlrichard Brühl believe that the document is not the original as it lacks a seal and the lines are unusually shaped.[30]\n\n",

It is preserved in its original form. In its basis, the cartulary is actually a chronicle of the Benedictine monastery which was founded around 1080 by a Croatian dignitary and slave owner Petar Crni (Peter the Black).[2]\n\nToday, it is kept in the treasury of the Cathedral of Saint Domnius in Split.",
        "Document claims": "The cartulary also contains a later addendum, with information on the political situation in late 11th century Croatia, naming six feudal noble families (Čudomirić, Kačić, Kukar, Mogorović, Snačić, Šubić) from which bans (viceroys) of Croatia, Bosnia, Slavonia, Požega, Podravina, Albania and Srijem were elected from and others which were eligible for being elected as župans and states that in the case that the reigning king of Croatia dies without an heir a new king is elected by the bans, giving primacy to the bans of Croatia, Bosnia, and Slavonia. However, the specific writing about bans is dated to the late 13th and early 14th century, and was constructed for political purposes.[5]",

        "Document description": "Charter of Duke Trpimir (Croatian: Povelja kneza Trpimira), also known as Trpimir's deed of donation (Croatian: Trpimirova darovnica) is the oldest preserved document of the Croatian law, the oldest from the court of one of the Croatian rulers and the first national document which mentions the Croatian name. Charter, dated to 4 March 852, is not preserved in its original form but in five subsequent transcripts out of which the oldest is from year 1568.\n\n",
        "Document claims": "Dating of the Charter is contained in the following sentence in Latin: Regnante in Italia piissimo Lothario Francorum rege per indictionem XV sub die IIII Nonis Martii (English: During the reign of a very pious Frankish king Lothair I in Italy, indiction 15, March 4).[1]\n\nHistorians Daniele Farlati and Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski considered that the indiction XV refers to the year 837, while Ivan Lučić Lucius considered that indiction refers to the year 838, which cannot be because of indiction.[2] Historian Franjo Rački corrected the opinion of Farlati and Kukuljević Sakcinski because Lothair I reigned as \"Francorum rex\", King of Franks, only since year 840, and also because, according to chronicler John the Deacon, Duke Mislav reigned over Duchy of Croatia in year 837. Accordingly, indiction XV can only refer to year 852.[3]\n\nMiho Barada gave the first extensive palaeographic-diplomatic analysis to attempt to reconstruct the original text.[4] In addition, valuable contributions were also given by Lovre Katić[5] and Marko Kostrenčić.[6] Držislav Švob considered this Charter to be forgery from 14th century because of its \"unconvincing arguments and arbitrary assumptions\".[7]\n\nIn recent years, the debate on the issue was renewed by Lujo Margetić who thought that, because Lothari had already left Italy in year 840 and succeeded his father to the imperial throne, it is very unlikely that Trpimir was unaware of that change on the imperial throne even twelve years later. According to Margetić, the real date when the document was written would be March 4, 840.[8] This Margetić's claim is supported by writings of John the Deacon according to which Justin was Archbishop of Split in year 840 after Archbishop Petar which is mentioned in the Charter.[9]\n\nThe question of authenticity of the Charter has emerged from the beginning of its historiographical research. Doubts about the authenticity stemmed from problems with the dating, misunderstanding of certain language terms, and also from the fact that the copies of the Charter passed through many hands and that the Charter itself is vague and contradictory in many parts because of that. Some of the evidences that the Charter is authentic are for example terms mancipatio and mancipare. According to Lujo Margetić, these terms indicate the ancient Roman forms of acquiring property and were at the time slowly disappearing as knowledge of Corpus Juris Civilis was growing by the activity of glossators, but they also linger at least in Italy even in the 9th century AD. Trpimir's and Muncimir's documents are evidence that those terms were known in Croatia. Olga Perić also came to the similar results noting that at least two old and different language layers can be found in the text of the Charter. Some interesting observations in support of Charter authenticity were presented by Neven Budak. First observation refers to the name of people from the Trpimir's escort that are mentioned in the eschatocol of the Charter, which points out that all the names are national, Croatian names, and not Christian, unless of course those from the priests. This is understandable because it was a time when only traditional names were prevailing among newly baptized nations. Budak disputes the contention that the institution of chaplain as a court scribe did not exist in the 9th century, stating that it is known in Bavaria in the 8th century and that it was accepted by Carolingian dynasty.[11]",

        "Document description": "Pacta conventa (Latin for \"agreed accords\") was an agreement concluded between King Coloman of Hungary and the Croatian nobility in 1102 or afterwards, defining the status of Croatia in the union with Hungary. The earliest manuscript of the document is of the fourteenth century, so some historians believe it is likely a forgery.\n\nThe document titled Pacta conventa or Qualiter (the first word in the document) was found in a Trogir library.[1] Until the 19th century it was considered that it dated to 1102. However, historians today hold that it is not an authentic document from 1102 and likely a forgery from the 14th century, but that the contents of the Pacta Conventa still correspond to the political situation of that time in Croatia.[2][3] The document is preserved in the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest.[4]",
        "Document claims": "The document's validity is questionable.[11] While some claim the earliest text concerning the alleged agreement came from the second half of the 14th century[6][12] others call it a late medieval forgery, not a twelfth-century source.[6][13] While various items of the text seem anachronistic to some, other historians say these could be reworkings of a text from an actual agreement.[12]\n\nSince the 19th century, a number of historians have claimed that the Pacta conventa was not a genuine document.\n\nIn 1915 and then also in 1925, Milan Šufflay mentioned the document in some of his works, first declaring it an outright forgery, and later saying it was a 14th-century \"addendum\" to the manuscript of Thomas the Archdeacon.[14] Hungarian historian János Karácsonyi thought it was a 14th-century forgery, Slovene historian Ljudmil Hauptmann dated the document to the 13th century, Croatian historians Miho Barada and Marko Kostrenčić thought it was made in 1102, while later Croatian historian Nada Klaić thought it was a forgery probably made in the 14th century. Croatian historian Stjepan Antoljak in turn said the Pacta was an incomplete historical source, but not a forgery.[14] Nada Klaić elaborated her \"lack of opinion\" over the matter of 1102 in a 1959 article disputing the Croatian writer Oleg Mandić's earlier work on the matter.[15]\n\nThe dispute and uncertainty over the Pacta conventa matches the overall uncertainty and dispute over the relationship between the Croatian and Hungarian kingdoms in the 10th and 11th century, with Croatian historian Ferdo Šišić and his followers assuming Tomislav of Croatia had ruled most of the area inhabited by Croats, including Slavonia, while the Hungarian historians Gyula Kristó, Bálint Hóman and János Karácsonyi thought the area between Drava and Sava belonged neither to Croatia nor to Hungary at the time, an opinion that Nada Klaić said she would not preclude, because the generic name \"Slavonia\" (lit. the land of the Slavs) may have implied so.[16]\n\nThough the validity of the document is disputed, there was at least a non-written agreement that regulated the relations between Hungary and Croatia in approximately the same way, since from 1102 until 1918 kings of Hungary were also kings of Croatia, represented by a governor (ban), but Croatia kept its own parliament (Sabor) and considerable autonomy.[17]\n\nThe source of inspiration for the text of the document must have been the political and social developments that had taken place over a 300-year period following 1102[6] when the two kingdoms united under the Hungarian king, either by the choice of the Croat nobility or by Hungarian force.[17] The Croatian nobility retained its laws and privileges including the restriction of military service that they owed to the king within the boundaries of Croatia.[6]",

According to this document, astronauts aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-75 performed a variety of sex acts to determine which positions are most effective in zero gravity. The document goes on to report that of the 10 positions tested, six required the use of a belt and an inflatable tunnel, while four were contingent on hanging on. The document also discusses a video record of the 10 one-hour sessions in the lower deck of the shuttle, and notes that the subjects added their own personal footnotes to help scientists.\n\n",

        "Document description": "The Donation of Constantine (Latin: Donatio Constantini) is a forged Roman imperial decree by which the 4th-century emperor Constantine the Great supposedly transferred authority over Rome and the western part of the Roman Empire to the Pope. Composed probably in the 8th century, it was used, especially in the 13th century, in support of claims of political authority by the papacy. \n\nIn many of the existing manuscripts (handwritten copies of the document), including the oldest one, the document bears the title Constitutum domini Constantini imperatoris.  The Donation of Constantine was included in the 9th-century Pseudo-Isidorean decretals. Lorenzo Valla, an Italian Catholic priest and Renaissance humanist, is credited with first exposing the forgery with solid philological arguments in 1439–1440,  although the document's authenticity had been repeatedly contested since 1001. ",
        "Document claims": "During the Middle Ages, the Donation was widely accepted as authentic, although Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor did possibly raise suspicions of the document \"in letters of gold\" as a forgery, in making a gift to the See of Rome.[13] It was not until the mid-15th century, with the revival of Classical scholarship and textual criticism, that humanists, and eventually the papal bureaucracy, began to realize that the document could not possibly be genuine. Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa declared it to be a forgery[18][19] and spoke of it as an apocryphal work. Later, the Catholic priest Lorenzo Valla argued in his philological study of the text that the language used in manuscript could not be dated to the 4th century.[20] The language of the text suggests that the manuscript can most likely be dated to the 8th century. Valla believed the forgery to be so obvious that he suspected that the Church knew the document to be inauthentic. Valla further argued that papal usurpation of temporal power had corrupted the church, caused the wars of Italy, and reinforced the \"overbearing, barbarous, tyrannical priestly domination.\"[20] Independently of both Cusa and Valla, Reginald Pecocke, Bishop of Chichester (1450–57), reached a similar conclusion. Among the indications that the Donation is a forgery are its language and the fact that, while certain imperial-era formulas are used in the text, some of the Latin in the document could not have been written in the 4th century; anachronistic terms such as \"fief\" were used. Also, the purported date of the document is inconsistent with the content of the document itself, as it refers both to the fourth consulate of Constantine (315) as well as the consulate of Gallicanus (317). Pope Pius II wrote a tract in 1453, five years before becoming pope, to show that though the Donation was a forgery, the papacy owed its lands to Charlemagne and its powers of the keys to Peter; however, he did not publish it.[21] Contemporary opponents of papal powers in Italy emphasized the primacy of civil law and civil jurisdiction, now firmly embodied once again in the Justinian Corpus Juris Civilis. The Florentine chronicler Giovanni Cavalcanti reported that, in the very year of Valla's treatise, Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, made diplomatic overtures toward Cosimo de' Medici in Florence, proposing an alliance against the pope. In reference to the Donation, Visconti wrote: \"It so happens that even if Constantine consigned to Sylvester so many and such rich gifts – which is doubtful, because such a privilege can nowhere be found – he could only have granted them for his lifetime: the empire takes precedence over any lordship.\"[citation needed] Later, scholars further demonstrated that other elements, such as Sylvester's curing of Constantine, are legends which originated at a later time. Wolfram Setz, a recent editor of Valla's work, has affirmed that at the time of Valla's refutation, Constantine's alleged \"donation\" was no longer a matter of contemporary relevance in political theory and that it simply provided an opportunity for an exercise in legal rhetoric.[22] The bulls of Nicholas V and his successors made no further mention of the Donation, even when partitioning the New World, though the doctrine of \"omni-insular\" papal fiefdoms, developed out of the Donation's vague references to islands since Pope Nicholas II's grant of Sicily to Robert Guiscard, was deployed after 1492 in papal pronouncements on the overlapping claims of the Iberian kingdoms in the Americas and Moluccas, including Inter caetera, a bull that resulted in the Treaty of Tordesillas and the Treaty of Zaragoza.[16][23] Valla's treatise was taken up vehemently by writers of the Protestant Reformation, such as Ulrich von Hutten and Martin Luther, causing the treatise to be placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum in the mid-16th century. The Donation continued to be tacitly accepted as authentic until Caesar Baronius in his Annales Ecclesiastici (published 1588–1607) admitted that it was a forgery, after which it was almost universally accepted as such.[2] Some continued to argue for its authenticity; nearly a century after Annales Ecclesiastici, Christian Wolff still alluded to the Donation as undisputed fact.[24]",

Among the indications that the Donation is a forgery are its language and the fact that, while certain imperial-era formulas are used in the text, some of the Latin in the document could not have been written in the 4th century; anachronistic terms such as \"fief\" were used. Also, the purported date of the document is inconsistent with the content of the document itself, as it refers both to the fourth consulate of Constantine (315) as well as the consulate of Gallicanus (317). Pope Pius II wrote a tract in 1453, five years before becoming pope, to show that though the Donation was a forgery, the papacy owed its lands to Charlemagne and its powers of the keys to Peter; however, he did not publish it."

The Florentine chronicler Giovanni Cavalcanti reported that, in the very year of Valla's treatise, Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, made diplomatic overtures toward Cosimo de' Medici in Florence, proposing an alliance against the pope. In reference to the Donation, Visconti wrote: \"It so happens that even if Constantine consigned to Sylvester so many and such rich gifts – which is doubtful, because such a privilege can nowhere be found – he could only have granted them for his lifetime: the empire takes precedence over any lordship.\"[citation needed] Later, scholars further demonstrated that other elements, such as Sylvester's curing of Constantine, are legends which originated at a later time. Wolfram Setz, a recent editor of Valla's work, has affirmed that at the time of Valla's refutation, Constantine's alleged \"donation\" was no longer a matter of contemporary relevance in political theory and that it simply provided an opportunity for an exercise in legal rhetoric."

It is attributed to the Bishop Pilgrim of Passau in 971 to 991 and contained forged epistles that dealt with the definition of the bishopric's jurisdiction.",
        "Document claims": "Most specialists agree that the collection of documents, known as the Forgeries of Lorch, was completed for Pilgrim, who was made Bishop of Passau in 971.   After he came into conflict with Frederick I, Archbishop of Salzburg for the ecclesiastic jurisdiction in Pannonia, Pilgrim forged the papal bulls.   The earliest of the bulls was attributed to the 4th-century Pope Symmachus. \n\nPilgrim believed that Lauriacum (now Lorch in Enns in Austria) was the metropolitan see of the Diocese of Pannonia in the Roman Empire.  He also thought that the see had been moved from Lauriacum to Passau. \n\nDocuments\nPilgrim's forgeries include six papal documents falsified or corrupted by Bishop Pilgrim of Passau between 971 and 985 as scribes of the royal firm, a letter from the bishop to Pope Benedict VI or Benedict VII. There were also two alleged letters of Archbishop Hatto from Mainz to an unnamed Pope. A total of five papal bulls were forged and one of the letters from Hatto of Mainz to an unknown Pope, attempted to prove that Lorch was an archiepiscopal see before Salzburg.  Pilgrim's counterfeits, were to make the diocese of Passau the legal successor to the ancient archbishopric of Lauriacum, thus establishing the rank of an archbishopric. This late antique bishopric Lauriacum (Lorch, Austria) was mentioned in the Vita Sancti Severini.\n\nOne of the specific contents involved the claim that Saint Peter sent missionaries to convert Lorch in the year 47 and establish a see.  Furthermore, the documents also indicated that Passau be endowed with a vast archdiocese, immense property, and no less than twenty-two suffragan bishoprics including Grado, Wurzburg, and Prague. ",

        "Document description": "Historias de la Conquista del Mayab (\"Histories of the Conquest of the Mayab\") is a Mexican manuscript ostensibly written in 1725 by an otherwise unknown friar, Joseph de San Buena Ventura, who compiled it from various older sources. ",
        "Document claims": "The manuscript is now regarded as a forgery created in the 1950s or 1960s, with information derived from a Spanish translation of Sylvanus G. Morley's 1947 book The Ancient Maya. It is written on modern paper, which cannot date from earlier than the 19th century.\n\nHistorias de la Conquista del Mayab appears to have been produced by the same forger as Las Memorias de Guerrero, the Historia de la pazificacion de las tierras de los indios itzaes y las ganzias de el tayasal y de todos los pueblos de la alaguna en el año 1697, and the Canek Manuscript, with which it bears a number of similarities.\n\nThe manuscript was acquired by the Archivo de Historia de México Condumex   in Mexico City shortly after 1970.",

The former two are Hebrew idioms, and the third is taken from the New Testament. The letter, therefore, gives a description of Jesus such as Christian piety conceived of him.[4]",

        "Document description": "Codex 2427 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), formerly known as Archaic Mark, is a miniature manuscript of the Gospel of Mark written in minuscule Greek. The manuscript had been very difficult to date paleographically and had been assigned to the 13th-18th century, until 2006 when it was proved a forgery following the publication of digital images of the codex, which had been made available online to renew interest in the manuscript.\n\nThe codex is written in a tiny minuscule hand on parchment leaves, containing 44 leaves (11.5 cm by 8.5 cm), written in one column per page, 21-25 lines per page. The codex has no sections, canons or headings, but it contains 16 colour illuminations.  There are no indications on the codex that it was originally part of a tetraevangelium. The codex includes text of Mark 16:9-20. \n\nThe codex 2427 was found among the possessions of John Askitopoulos, an Athenian collector and dealer of antiquities, after his death in 1917. In 1937 the manuscript was sent to the University of Chicago Library, where it still resides (Ms. 972). \n\nIllustrations are very similar to those from minuscule 777. Robert S. Nelson suggested that they were copied from 777. ",
        "Document claims": "The manuscript found some early critics upon arriving in Chicago. Robert P. Casey \"voiced his suspicion in 1947\".[8] In 1988 Mary V. Orna found that one of the illustrations contained Prussian blue (KFe[Fe(CN)6]), produced since 1704 only.[9] This did not resolve the question of authenticity, however, as it was \"conceivable that the illuminations could have been retouched in a naïve attempt at restoration.\"[10]\n\nIn early 2006 the University of Chicago announced that digital images of the manuscript had appeared online in an effort to \"foster further research.\"[11] By February Stephen Carlson had announced his findings that the codex was a forgery, and proved his case beyond a doubt at the 2006 Annual Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature.[10] Its text has been copied from Philipp Buttmann's 1860 Greek New Testament edition (based on Cardinal Mai's edition of Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209).[12] This is especially obvious since the forger also followed Buttmann in 81 out of 85 places where his edition departed from the Codex Vaticanus text. Furthermore, in three places the copyist of 2427 had accidentally omitted a line (6:2, 8:12, 14:14), and it transpired that in each verse the omitted text corresponds exactly to the lineation of Buttmann's edition.[13]\n\nFurthermore, microscopic, chemical and codicological testing eventually proved in 2009 that the manuscript had been made in 1874 at the earliest.[14]\n\nWhat made the text a forgery was that it was carefully manufactured in the style of a medieval codex, when it was in fact a very recent creation, no older than the late 19th century. What originally made scholars so suspicious was that it was textually the closest known manuscript – in fact, virtually identical – to Codex Vaticanus, but of a much later date. Furthermore, Greek codices of a single gospel are extremely unusual, further contributing to the suspicion that it was made as a souvenir.",

        "Document description": "The “Oath of a Freeman” was a loyalty pledge required of all new members of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 1630s.  Printed as a broadside by Stephen Daye in 1639, it is the first document from a printing press known to have been produced in the present day United States. No copies are known to exist, but the text is known from a handwritten copy and a 1647 book. \n\nA supposed original printing of the document surfaced in 1985,  but it was later revealed to be the work of forger Mark Hofmann. \n\nOriginal printing\nThe “Oath” was a vow of obedience to the company's government and a promise not to conspire against it.  Previous examples of oaths in England pledged loyalty to the Crown.  The absence of references to the King made the “Oath” a uniquely American document.  The earliest known version of the “Oath” was handwritten by Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop in 1631.  Governor Winthrop stated in his diary that the “Oath” was the “first thing” printed by Stephen Daye in 1638 or 1639.  Stephen Daye was an English locksmith who sailed to Boston in 1638 with a Puritan cleric who had smuggled a printing press on board the ship.  After the cleric and his printer died at sea, Daye and his sons took possession of the press and set up Cambridge Press, the first printing company in America, in Boston.  Before 1638, all printed materials in America were produced in England and shipped across the Atlantic.  The earliest known American imprint that had been found prior to 1685 was the Bay Psalm Book, which Daye printed in 1640.  Daye's printing of the “Oath” had not been reported as seen since 1647, and according to historian Lawrence C. Wroth, “the probability that one will some day be found has never ceased to excite the New England collector.” ",
        "Document claims": "The break from English monarchy, combined with the document's status as the first document printed in America, conferred a special status on the “Oath”. Thus, there was considerable interest when a rare-documents dealer, Mark Hofmann, claimed to have found a broadside of the “Oath” in a New York bookstore in 1985. In 1985, Hofmann's print of the “Oath” was offered for sale to both the Library of Congress and the American Antiquarian Society, at a reported asking price of US$1.5 million. Further forged copies of the Oath printed by Hofmann were sold to private individuals, as well. The Library of Congress declared that the discovery “would be one of the most important and exciting finds of the century” and stated that its examination “found nothing inconsistent with a mid-17th century attribution”. The American Antiquarian Society had possession of the document for two months and announced, “as far as we know, there are no anomalies”. Both organizations wanted to undertake further testing of the “Oath” to determine its authenticity and remained interested in acquiring the document despite some troubling events after its discovery.\n\nIn fact, the purported discovery was a clever forgery by Hofmann. The deception began to unravel when Steven Christensen, a prominent leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and one of Hofmann's customers, was killed by a pipe bomb left at his office in downtown Salt Lake City in October 1985. A day later, Hofmann was badly injured by a pipe bomb placed in his automobile.[1] Hofmann later pled guilty to the bombings. In the investigation of the murders, police investigators uncovered Hofmann's forgeries, which ran to hundreds of documents—all or nearly all documents and historical artifacts \"discovered\" by Hofmann in his career—including the Oath of a Freeman.\n\nHofmann demonstrated considerable skill in the creation of his forgeries. He acquired or stole paper that was manufactured appropriate to the time of the documents he forged.[8] He made his own ink and used chemical processes to age his documents in order to make them look authentic. He would acquire old books from the era in question, find the blank pages that were always inserted at the front and the back of the book, cut those out and use the paper for some of his forgeries.[8] He learned to hypnotize himself in order to fluidly copy the signatures of historical figures.[4] His forgeries fooled experts in the field, such as Charles Hamilton, Kenneth W. Rendell, and investigators at the National Archives and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[3] During his confession, Hofmann stated that he did most of his printing from plates that he made himself but “got lazy and had the ‘Oath’ plate made professionally\".[8]",

Further forged copies of the Oath printed by Hofmann were sold to private individuals, as well. The Library of Congress declared that the discovery “would be one of the most important and exciting finds of the century” and stated that its examination “found nothing inconsistent with a mid-17th century attribution”. The American Antiquarian Society had possession of the document for two months and announced, “as far as we know, there are no anomalies”. Both organizations wanted to undertake further testing of the “Oath” to determine its authenticity and remained interested in acquiring the document despite some troubling events after its discovery.",

        "Document description": "Pamiętnik handlowca (A Merchant's Memoir, or Memoirs of a Merchant; in Latin, Memorialium commercatori) is the name of a purported  diary  written by a Polish merchant, Zbigniew Stefański, in 1625. No copy of the original text is known to exist.  The diary was said to be written in Old Polish and to contain a first-hand account of the Jamestown Colony in Virginia. It was claimed to be the only extant primary source from the Jamestown Colony that provides the perspective of Polish artisans who had been brought in by Captain John Smith in 1608.         As the existence of the diary has been confirmed by only a single researcher, its veracity and very existence have been questioned. \n\n",
        "Document claims": "The Memoir is said to have surfaced in Chicago, Illinois, in 1947, when a person offered to sell it to Mieczysław Haiman, the director of the Polish Museum of America.[1] The book was popularized through the writings of the journalist and ethnographer Arthur Waldo, who claimed to have seen it and to have made a partial copy for his records, but more recently, researchers have questioned the authenticity of the source, which cannot be located in any museum, library, or collection. Waldo claimed that his copy had been given away and refused to provide further details to fellow researchers. James S. Pula in 2008 concluded, \"Given all of the vain attempts to locate so much as a single reference to the Pamietnik, let alone an extant copy, it would appear that, unless some independent verification surfaces, Stefański's memoir must be rejected as a legitimate source.\"[1]",

        "Document description": "Pata Khazāna (Pashto: پټه خزانه, lit. 'Hidden Treasure') is the title of a manuscript written in the Pashto language. According to its discoverer, the script contains an anthology of Pashto poetry, which precedes the earliest known works of Pashto literature by hundreds of years. The manuscript is widely viewed as a forgery.\n\n",
        "Document claims": "The Afghan scholar Abdul Hai Habibi claimed to have discovered the manuscript in 1944. He claimed it was a 19th-century copy of an anthology of Pashto poetry written in 1729 in Kandahar by Shah Hussain Hotak. The anthology is a compilation of works of hitherto unknown poets dating back to the eighth century. Habibi published the manuscript as a facsimile in 1975 but did not make the original document available for historical testing due to the scholars not following the UN protocol. The original book resides at Afghan archives in Kabul for viewing. Since the publication of the first edition of the book, some scholars have raised doubts about its authenticity. Habibi dismissed such critics, stating that their arguments were not \"scientifically based\".[1] Nevertheless, most experts consider it to be a forgery.[2]\n\nThe earliest known document written in Pashto is dated to the sixteenth century. The poems compiled in the Pata Khazana therefore extend the history of Pashto literature by about 800 years. The first translation into a European language, with a detailed critical commentary, only appeared in 1987, written by the Italian Iranologist Lucia Serena Loi. The most intensive critical occupation with the manuscript among Pashto scholars was published by the Pashtun scholar Qalandar Mohmand in 1988. Another scholar Juma Khan Sufi in his critical exposition of Pata Khazana also questions the authenticity of the Pata Khazana.\n\nAs the original manuscript is not available to the public, the authenticity of the document could only be checked by analyzing the orthography and style of the facsimile. Due to the large number of errors and anachronisms found in the script, the authenticity of the manuscript is widely excluded among scholars of Iranian studies. Some scholars, however, do not want to rule out completely the authenticity of at least parts of some poems compiled in the manuscript.[citation needed]\n\nThere is no consensus on the time of fabrication. Loi considers the manuscript a forgery of the late 19th century,[3] while the Iranologist David Neil MacKenzie concludes from the anachronisms that the document was fabricated only shortly before its claimed discovery in 1944. MacKenzie's central argument refers to the use of the modern Pashto letters ẓ̌e  and ṇun throughout the script. These letters were only introduced into the Pashto alphabet in 1936 when the Afghan government reformed the Pashto orthography. MacKenzie claims that the two letters have never been found simultaneously in any genuine manuscript before 1935.[4]",

        "Document description": "The Privilegium maius (German: Großer Freiheitsbrief 'greater privilege') was a set of medieval documents forged in 1358 or 1359 at the behest of Duke Rudolf IV of Austria (1358–65) of the House of Habsburg. It was essentially a modified version of the Privilegium minus issued by Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1156, which had elevated the former March of Austria into a duchy. In a similar way, the Privilegium maius elevated the duchy into an Archduchy of Austria.\n\nThe privileges described in the documents had great influence on the Austrian political landscape, and created a unique connection between the House of Habsburg and Austria.\n\nThe House of Habsburg had gained rulership of the Duchy of Austria in 1282. Rudolph IV (1339–1365) attempted to restore the Habsburg influence on the European political scene by trying to build relations with Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg and increasing the respect of the Austrian rulers. However, Rudolph IV did not belong to the seven Prince-electors, who—as dictated by the Golden Bull of 1356—had the power to choose the king. In the same way Charles IV had made Prague the center of his rule, Rudolph did the same for Vienna, giving it special privileges, launching construction projects and founding the University of Vienna. All this aimed at increasing the legitimacy and influence of the House and its Austrian lands. For this purpose, in the winter of 1358/1359, Rudolph IV ordered the creation of a forged document called Privilegium maius (\"the greater privilege\").[1]\nThe Privilegium maius consists of five forged deeds, some of which purported to have been issued by Julius Caesar and Nero to the historic Roman province of Noricum, which was roughly coterminous with the modern Austrian borders. ",
        "Document claims": "The Privilegium maius consists of five forged deeds, some of which purported to have been issued by Julius Caesar and Nero to the historic Roman province of Noricum, which was roughly coterminous with the modern Austrian borders. Though purposefully modeled on the Privilegium minus, the original of which \"got lost\" at the same time, the bundle was already identified as a fake by contemporaries such as the Italian scholar Petrarch.\n\nIn the Privilegium maius, Rudolf IV declared Austria an \"archduchy\", endowed with rights similar to those of the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire such as:\n\ninseparability of the territory\nautomatic inheritance of the first-born (primogeniture), later extended to female heirs in the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 in favour of Archduchess Maria Theresa\nindependent jurisdiction and legislature, without any possibility to appeal to the Emperor (privilegium de non evocando)\npermission to display certain symbols of rule\nRudolf also created the title Pfalzerzherzog (\"Archduke Palatine\"), similar to the Elector Palatine of the Rhine, the holder of an electoral vote. The first Habsburg ruler who actually used the title of an archduke was Ernest of Iron, ruler of Inner Austria from 1406 to 1424. From the 15th century onward, all princes of the Habsburg dynasty were called Erzherzöge.\n\nEmperor Charles IV refused to confirm the Privilegium maius, although he accepted some claims.[2][3] The discoverer of the forgery was his advisor, the poet and scholar Petrarch.[4][5] However, Frederick III, of the House of Habsburg, who became Holy Roman Emperor, 1452, confirmed the document and made it part of imperial law, thus making fiction into fact.[6][3] From then on, the status as claimed by the document became widely accepted.[7] Frederick also extended the Privilegium Maius by granting the power of ennoblement for his family as hereditary rulers of Austria (this power was normally reserved for the emperor).[8] Thus, the act of confirmation by Frederick was what elevated the House of Habsburg to a special rank within the Empire.[7][9][a]\n\nThe Privilegium maius had great influence on the Austrian political landscape. The Habsburg archduke arrogated an almost king-like position, and demonstrated this to outsiders through the usage of special insignia. The Habsburgs gained a new foundation for their rule in these lands; in a way, the House of Habsburg and Austria became a single unit. The family subsequently published special editions of the documents, and forbade all discussion of their authenticity.[1]\n\nWith the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Privilegium maius finally lost its meaning. In 1852, it was proven a forgery by historian Wilhelm Wattenbach.",

        "Document description": "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (Russian: Протоколы сионских мудрецов), or The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion (Протоколы собраний ученых сионских мудрецов), is a fabricated text purporting to detail a Jewish plot for global domination. Largely plagiarized from several earlier sources, it was first published in Imperial Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century. It played a key part in popularizing belief in an international Jewish conspiracy.\n\nBeginning in 1933, distillations of the work were assigned by some German teachers, as if they were factual, to be read by German schoolchildren throughout Nazi Germany,  although the text had been exposed as fraudulent by the British newspaper The Times in 1921 and by the German newspaper Frankfurter Zeitung in 1924. Today, it remains widely available in numerous languages, in print and on the Internet, and continues to be presented by antisemitic groups as a genuine document. It has been described as \"probably the most influential work of antisemitism ever written\" since it emerged from Russia shortly before World War I. ",
        "Document claims": "The Protocols is a fabricated document purporting to be factual. Textual evidence shows that it could not have been produced prior to 1901: the document alludes to the assassinations of Umberto I (d. 1900) and William McKinley, for example, as though these events were plotted out in advance.[3] The title of Sergei Nilus' widely distributed first edition contains the dates \"1902–1903\", and it is likely that the document was actually written at this time in Russia.[4] Cesare G. De Michelis argues that it was manufactured in the months after a Russian Zionist congress in September 1902, and that it was originally a parody of Jewish idealism meant for internal circulation among antisemites until it was decided to clean it up and publish it as if it were real. Self-contradictions in various testimonies show that the individuals involved—including the text's initial publisher, Pavel Krushevan—deliberately obscured the origins of the text and lied about it in the decades afterwards.[5]\n\nIf the placement of the forgery in 1902–1903 Russia is correct, then it was written at the beginning of a series of anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire, in which thousands of Jews were killed or fled the country. Many of the people whom De Michelis suspects of involvement in the forgery were directly responsible for inciting the pogroms.[6]\n\nThe Protocols is one of the best-known and most-discussed examples of literary forgery, with analysis and proof of its fraudulent origin dating as far back as 1921.[11] The forgery is an early example of \"conspiracy theory\" literature.[12] Written mainly in the first person plural,[b] the text includes generalizations, truisms, and platitudes on how to take over the world: take control of the media and the financial institutions, change the traditional social order, etc. It does not contain specifics.[14]\n\nAccording to Daniel Pipes,\n\nThe book's vagueness—almost no names, dates, or issues are specified—has been one key to this wide-ranging success. The purportedly Jewish authorship also helps to make the book more convincing. Its embrace of contradiction—that to advance, Jews use all tools available, including capitalism and communism, philo-Semitism and antisemitism, democracy and tyranny—made it possible for The Protocols to reach out to all: rich and poor, Right and Left, Christian and Muslim, American and Japanese.[14]\n\nPipes notes that the Protocols emphasizes recurring themes of conspiratorial antisemitism: \"Jews always scheme\", \"Jews are everywhere\", \"Jews are behind every institution\", \"Jews obey a central authority, the shadowy 'Elders'\", and \"Jews are close to success.\"[30]\n\nAs fiction in the genre of literature, the tract was analyzed by Umberto Eco in his novel Foucault's Pendulum (1988):\n\nThe great importance of The Protocols lies in its permitting antisemites to reach beyond their traditional circles and find a large international audience, a process that continues to this day. The forgery poisoned public life wherever it appeared; it was \"self-generating; a blueprint that migrated from one conspiracy to another.\"[31]\n\nEco also dealt with the Protocols in 1994 in chapter 6, \"Fictional Protocols\", of his Six Walks in the Fictional Woods and in his 2010 novel The Cemetery of Prague.\n\nThe Times exposed the Protocols as a forgery on August 16–18, 1921.\nIn 1920–1921, the history of the concepts found in the Protocols was traced back to the works of Goedsche and Jacques Crétineau-Joly by Lucien Wolf (an English Jewish journalist), and published in London in August 1921. But a dramatic exposé occurred in the series of articles in The Times by its Constantinople reporter, Philip Graves, who discovered the plagiarism from the work of Maurice Joly.[20]\n\nAccording to writer Peter Grose, Allen Dulles, who was in Constantinople developing relationships in post-Ottoman political structures, discovered \"the source\" of the documentation and ultimately provided him to The Times. Grose writes that The Times extended a loan to the source, a Russian émigré who refused to be identified, with the understanding the loan would not be repaid.[68] Colin Holmes, a lecturer in economic history at Sheffield University, identified the émigré as Mikhail Raslovlev, a self-identified antisemite, who gave the information to Graves so as not to \"give a weapon of any kind to the Jews, whose friend I have never been.\"[69]\n\nIn the first article of Graves' series, titled \"A Literary Forgery\", the editors of The Times wrote, \"our Constantinople Correspondent presents for the first time conclusive proof that the document is in the main a clumsy plagiarism. He has forwarded us a copy of the French book from which the plagiarism is made.\"[20] In the same year, an entire book[70] documenting the hoax was published in the United States by Herman Bernstein. Despite this widespread and extensive debunking, the Protocols continued to be regarded as important factual evidence by antisemites. Dulles, a successful lawyer and career diplomat, attempted to persuade the US State Department to publicly denounce the forgery, but without success.[71]\n\nBerne Trial \n\nVladimir Burtsev, a Russian émigré, anti-Bolshevik and anti-Fascist who exposed numerous Okhrana agents provocateurs in the early 1900s, served as a witness at the Berne Trial. In 1938 in Paris he published a book, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Proved Forgery, based on his testimony.\n\nOn November 1, 1937, the defendants appealed the verdict to the Obergericht (Cantonal Supreme Court) of Bern. A panel of three judges acquitted them, holding that the Protocols, while false, did not violate the statute at issue because they were \"political publications\" and not \"immoral (obscene) publications (Schundliteratur)\" in the strict sense of the law.[72] The presiding judge's opinion stated, though, that the forgery of the Protocols was not questionable and expressed regret that the law did not provide adequate protection for Jews from this sort of literature. The court refused to impose the fees of defense of the acquitted defendants to the plaintiffs, and the acquitted Theodor Fischer had to pay 100 Fr. to the total state costs of the trial (Fr. 28,000) that were eventually paid by the canton of Bern.[73] This decision gave grounds for later allegations that the appeal court \"confirmed authenticity of the Protocols\" which is contrary to the facts.\n\nEvidence presented at the trial, which strongly influenced later accounts up to the present, was that the Protocols were originally written in French by agents of the Tzarist secret police (the Okhrana).[42] However, this version has been questioned by several modern scholars.[42] Michael Hagemeister discovered that the primary witness Alexandre du Chayla had previously written in support of the blood libel, had received four thousand Swiss francs for his testimony, and was secretly doubted even by the plaintiffs.[41] Charles Ruud and Sergei Stepanov concluded that there is no substantial evidence of Okhrana involvement and strong circumstantial evidence against it.[74]\n\nHitler refers to the Protocols in Mein Kampf:\n\n... [The Protocols] are based on a forgery, the Frankfurter Zeitung moans [ ] every week ... [which is] the best proof that they are authentic ... the important thing is that with positively terrifying certainty they reveal the nature and activity of the Jewish people and expose their inner contexts as well as their ultimate final aims.[79]\n\nThe Protocols also became a part of the Nazi propaganda effort to justify persecution of the Jews. In The Holocaust: The Destruction of European Jewry 1933–1945, Nora Levin states that \"Hitler used the Protocols as a manual in his war to exterminate the Jews\":\n\nDespite conclusive proof that the Protocols were a gross forgery, they had sensational popularity and large sales in the 1920s and 1930s. They were translated into every language of Europe and sold widely in Arab lands, the US, and England. But it was in Germany after World War I that they had their greatest success. There they were used to explain all of the disasters that had befallen the country: the defeat in the war, the hunger, the destructive inflation.[80]\n\nItaly\nFascist politician Giovanni Preziosi published the first Italian edition of the Protocols in 1921.[89][page needed] The book however had little impact until the mid-1930s. A new 1937 edition had a much higher impact, and three further editions in the following months sold 60,000 copies total.[89][page needed] The fifth edition had an introduction by Julius Evola, which argued around the issue of forgery, stating: \"The problem of the authenticity of this document is secondary and has to be replaced by the much more serious and essential problem of its truthfulness\".[89][page needed]\n\nMiddle East\nNeither governments nor political leaders in most parts of the world have referred to the Protocols since World War II. The exception to this is the Middle East, where a large number of Arab and Muslim regimes and leaders have endorsed them as authentic, including endorsements from Presidents Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat of Egypt, President Abdul Salam Arif of Iraq,[90] King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, and Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi of Libya.[91][92] A translation made by an Arab Christian appeared in Cairo in 1927 or 1928, this time as a book. The first translation by an Arab Muslim was also published in Cairo, but only in 1951.[91]\n\nThe 1988 charter of Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist group, stated that the Protocols embodies the plan of the Zionists.[93] The reference was removed in the new covenant issued in 2017.[94] Recent endorsements in the 21st century have been made by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Sheikh Ekrima Sa'id Sabri, and the education ministry of Saudi Arabia.[92] The Palestinian Solidarity Committee of South Africa distributed copies of the Protocols at the World Conference against Racism 2001.[95] The book was sold during the conference in the exhibition tent set up for the distribution of the antiracist literature.[96][97]\n\nHowever, figures within the region have publicly asserted that The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a forgery such as former Grand Mufti of Egypt Ali Gomaa, who made an official court complaint concerning a publisher who falsely put his name on an introduction to its Arabic translation.[98]",

        "Document description": "The salamander letter was a controversial document about the history of the Latter Day Saint movement that later proved to be a forgery. \n\nThe letter was one of hundreds of documents concerning the history of the Latter Day Saint movement that surfaced in the early 1980s. The salamander letter presented a view of the life of the movement's founder, Joseph Smith, that stood sharply at odds with the commonly accepted version of the early progression of the church Smith established.\n\nInitially accepted by some document experts and collectors, and rejected by others, [page needed] the salamander letter generated much discussion and debate inside and outside the Latter Day Saint movement. Kenneth W. Rendell, a prominent dealer of historical papers, lent credence to the salamander letter by stating that the ink, paper, and postmark were all consistent with the period; he concluded that \"there is no indication that the document is a forgery.\"  The document was later demonstrated to be a forgery created by Mark Hofmann, who had been responsible for the forgery of many other notable documents. Rendell then recast his conclusion, stating that while there was \"the absence of any indication of forgery in the letter itself, there was also no evidence that it was genuine.\" ",
        "Document claims": "The letter was initially deemed authentic by experienced document examiners, however this conclusion is disputed.[5] Critics of the LDS Church[who?] have used the letter as an argument against the validity of the religion. The letter was useful to these organizations because it seemed to support the opinions of Reed Durham, D. Michael Quinn,[6] and others regarding \"magical\" aspects of Smith's religious experiences.\n\nHofmann drew suspicion for discovering so many astounding documents that others had missed, including the so-called \"Oath of a Freeman\", which he was attempting to sell to the Library of Congress.\n\nBy early 1984, Jerald Tanner concluded there was significant doubt as to the salamander letter's authenticity. He even went so far as to publish an attack on the document, which surprised many scholars and students since this and other \"discoveries\" of important Mormon documents by Hofmann often appeared to bolster the Tanners' own arguments.[10] By late 1984, Jerald Tanner questioned the authenticity of most if not all of Hofmann's \"discoveries\", based in large part on their unproven provenance. The Tanners did concur with Hofmann in contending that the LDS Church's apparent inability to discern the forged documents was evidence against church leadership being divinely inspired. John Tvedtnes, a Mormon scholar, responded with Joseph Smith's statement that \"a prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such,\" and that purchasing historical materials is a business activity rather than a prophetic undertaking.[11] It is also asserted that the LDS Church's leaders do not claim infallibility[12][13] and that the church's efforts to obtain and archive historically significant material extend to works even by anti-Mormon authors.\n\nHofmann was struggling under massive debt and falling behind on delivering on deals that he had made. In 1985, when he learned that the pedigree of the salamander letter was under widespread suspicion, he produced and placed a number of bombs. They were detonated with a mercury switch, but without a safety switch. Two people were killed: Christensen at his office, the main target; and Kathleen Sheets at her home. That bomb was intended as a diversion, to draw off investigators by causing them to focus on unrelated business dealings between Christensen and Sheets's husband. Hofmann himself was subsequently injured when a third bomb went off prematurely in his car. That bomb exploded in a way that most of the blast did not hit Hofmann.\n\nThe police investigated these bombings, and during a search of Hofmann's home found a studio in the basement where he could create counterfeited documents as well as a semi-automatic carbine which had been converted to full automatic fire. Many of the documents Hofmann sold or donated were proven to be forgeries by a new forensic technique developed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, chiefly to detect his forgeries.\n\nThe Salt Lake City Police Department used Utah State special agent and forensic examiner George Throckmorton and Arizona document examiner William Flynn to examine a poem supposedly written by Harris and placed in his old Book of Common Prayer and determined it had actually been created by Hofmann. Hofmann used the poem to authenticate the writing in the salamander letter. Although this was enough proof by itself that the letter was a forgery, Throckmorton and Flynn bolstered their case by getting in touch with Frances Magee, the widow of a descendant of Robert Harris. Magee's family had owned the book for many years, and Magee told investigators that she'd never seen the poem before. She suspected someone had planted it there after she sold the book. Hofmann ultimately pleaded guilty to his forgeries and murders and was sentenced to life in prison.[14]\n\nChurch leaders, especially First Presidency member Gordon B. Hinckley, continued to field criticism for some time for \"being duped\" and being \"unable to discern the evil intentions of a man like Hofmann\". Hinckley later noted: \"I accepted him to come into my office on a basis of trust … I frankly admit that Hofmann tricked us. He also tricked experts from New York to Utah, however .... I am not ashamed to admit that we were victimized. It is not the first time the Church has found itself in such a position. Joseph Smith was victimized again and again. The Savior was victimized. I am sorry to say that sometimes it happens.\"[15]\n\nFollowing the Hofmann trial, in a speech at Brigham Young University titled \"Recent Events Involving Church History and Forged Documents\", Dallin H. Oaks addressed media critiques of the church, saying:\n\nI was saddened but not surprised that the news coverage of the truth about the forgeries and lies of Mark Hofmann was small by comparison with the earlier trumpeting of the claims that his newly discovered documents destroyed faith... In the course of this episode, we have seen some of the most sustained and intense LDS church-bashing since the turn of the century. In a circumstance where The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints could not say much without interfering with the pending criminal investigation and prosecution, the Church and its leaders have been easy marks for assertions and innuendo ranging from charges of complicity in murder to repeated recitals that the Church routinely acquires and suppresses Church history documents in order to deceive its members and the public. In the hands of clever writers and cartoonists, the mythical salamander proved a most effective instrument to pique public interest...\n\nIn addition to addressing the media's treatment of the church during this period, Oaks also spoke about other concerns including alleged suppression of documents, Hofmann's access to church officials, actual amounts paid for documents, and reminders of the many cautions Church leaders gave as to the documents' authenticity prior to Hofmann's arrest.\n\nIn addressing why Hofmann's lies were not detected by church leaders, Oaks said:\n\nIn order to perform their personal ministries, Church leaders cannot be suspicious and questioning of each of the hundreds of people they meet each year. Ministers of the gospel function best in an atmosphere of trust and love. In that kind of atmosphere, they fail to detect a few deceivers, but that is the price they pay to increase their effectiveness in counseling, comforting, and blessing the hundreds of honest and sincere people they see. It is better for a Church leader to be occasionally disappointed than to be constantly suspicious.\n\nMore than twenty years later, effects of the letter still lingered. The letter was referenced in research by both Mormons and critics of Mormonism alike. Resulting publications that include conclusions based on the presumption that the letter was authentic are still available and may influence the opinions of those seeking information on \"deep Mormon doctrine\" or evidence to support a naturalistic or magical historical view of Mormonism or Joseph Smith.\n\nGrant H. Palmer, author of the book An Insider's View of Mormon Origins, stated that his work was influenced in part by his original acceptance of the salamander letter as being valid and supportive of his view.[16] Palmer stated that the \"salamander letter\" caused him to explore Joseph Smith's \"mystical mindset\".[17]\n\nThe salamander letter also influenced the content of the film The God Makers II, an alleged exposé of Mormonism. The film suggests that Joseph Smith was required to dig up his brother Alvin's body and bring a part of it with him to the hill Cumorah in order to obtain the golden plates from which the Book of Mormon was said to be translated. Jerald and Sandra Tanner refuted this suggestion and determined that the only known source of such a requirement would have been the salamander letter.[18]",

                        "claim": "Following the Hofmann trial, in a speech at Brigham Young University titled \"Recent Events Involving Church History and Forged Documents\", Dallin H. Oaks addressed media critiques of the church, saying:\n\nI was saddened but not surprised that the news coverage of the truth about the forgeries and lies of Mark Hofmann was small by comparison with the earlier trumpeting of the claims that his newly discovered documents destroyed faith... In the course of this episode, we have seen some of the most sustained and intense LDS church-bashing since the turn of the century. In a circumstance where The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints could not say much without interfering with the pending criminal investigation and prosecution, the Church and its leaders have been easy marks for assertions and innuendo ranging from charges of complicity in murder to repeated recitals that the Church routinely acquires and suppresses Church history documents in order to deceive its members and the public. In the hands of clever writers and cartoonists, the mythical salamander proved a most effective instrument to pique public interest...\n\nIn addition to addressing the media's treatment of the church during this period, Oaks also spoke about other concerns including alleged suppression of documents, Hofmann's access to church officials, actual amounts paid for documents, and reminders of the many cautions Church leaders gave as to the documents' authenticity prior to Hofmann's arrest.\n\nIn addressing why Hofmann's lies were not detected by church leaders, Oaks said:\n\nIn order to perform their personal ministries, Church leaders cannot be suspicious and questioning of each of the hundreds of people they meet each year. Ministers of the gospel function best in an atmosphere of trust and love. In that kind of atmosphere, they fail to detect a few deceivers, but that is the price they pay to increase their effectiveness in counseling, comforting, and blessing the hundreds of honest and sincere people they see. It is better for a Church leader to be occasionally disappointed than to be constantly suspicious.\n\nMore than twenty years later, effects of the letter still lingered. The letter was referenced in research by both Mormons and critics of Mormonism alike. Resulting publications that include conclusions based on the presumption that the letter was authentic are still available and may influence the opinions of those seeking information on \"deep Mormon doctrine\" or evidence to support a naturalistic or magical historical view of Mormonism or Joseph Smith.\n\nGrant H. Palmer, author of the book An Insider's View of Mormon Origins, stated that his work was influenced in part by his original acceptance of the salamander letter as being valid and supportive of his view.",

This became known as the so-called \"Testament of Peter the Great\", which Napoleon Bonaparte used for anti-Russian propaganda purposes in 1812, and has been widely publicised since, although scholars have since established that the document is a forgery.[5][6][7]\n\nIn 1812, Charles-Louis Lesur [fr] wrote, under Napoleon's command, a memoir Des Progrès de la puissance russe depuis son origine jusqu'au commencement du XIXe siècle (\"Progress of the Russian Power, from Its Origin to the Beginning of the Nineteenth Century\"), in which a summary of the alleged Will was inserted. The memoir intended to justify Napoleon's war plans against Russia.[1]\n\nWalter K. Kelly in his History of Russia (1854) quotes The Will from Frederic Gaillardet's Mémoires du Chevalier d'Éon (1836). Gaillardet claimed that this document was stolen from Russia by d'Éon. While questioning its authenticity, Kelly comments that the document fairly reflects the politics of Russia in the past 100 years.[2] The same was noted by Russian historian Sergey Shubinsky, who commented that the first 11 points of The Will is a fair recapitulation of Russian foreign policy since Peter's death (1725) until 1812.[2]\n\nKarl Marx, writing in David Urquhart's The Free Press in 1857 was also in agreement.[8] Marx wrote that \"Peter the Great is indeed the inventor of modern Russian policy, but he became so only by divesting the old Muscovite method... generalizing its purpose, and exalting its object from the overthrow of certain given limits of power to the aspiration of unlimited power.\"[9][8] In a speech in 1867, Marx stated that \"the policy of Russia is changeless... the polar star of its policy – world domination – is a fixed star.\" Marx continued, \"Peter the Great touched this weak point when he wrote that in order to conquer the world, the Muscovites needed only souls.\"[10]\n\nIn 1912, Polish historian Michel Sokolnicki (Michał Sokolnicki) found in archives of French Ministry of Foreign Affairs a 1797 memorandum \"Aperçu sur la Russie of his ancestor, general Michał Sokolnicki and wrote a journal article \"Le Testament de Pierre le Grand: Origines d'un prétendu document historique\".[11] General Sokolnicki claimed that he glimpsed a plan of Peter I to subjugate Europe in Russian archives and memorized major points. These points bear a remarkable similarity to those presented by Lesur, so it is quite possible that Lesur borrowed from Sokolnicky.[2] Historian Sokolnicki also maintains that his ancestor did not invent The Will himself, but rather wrote down a long-existing Polish tradition.[11]",

The map first came to light in 1957 and was acquired by Yale University. It became well known due to the publicity campaign which accompanied its revelation to the public as a \"genuine\" pre-Columbian map in 1965. In addition to showing Africa, Asia and Europe, the map depicts a landmass south-west of Greenland in the Atlantic labelled as Vinland (Vinlanda Insula).\n\nThe map describes this region as having been visited by Europeans in the 11th century. Although it was presented to the world in 1965 with an accompanying scholarly book written by British Museum and Yale University librarians, historians of geography and medieval document specialists began to suspect that it might be a fake as soon as photographs of it became available, and chemical analyses have identified one of the major ink ingredients as a 20th-century artificial pigment.",
        "Document claims": "Controversies and investigations, 1966–2018\nVinland Map Conference, 1966\nMany academic reviewers of The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation took the opportunity to point out evidence that called the map's authenticity into question. So a year later, a Vinland Map Conference was held at the Smithsonian Institution, during which further significant questions were asked, particularly of Witten. However, the proceedings were not published for another five years.[4]\n\nThere were questions about the actual content of the map. Witten had pointed out that it bore strong resemblances to a map made in the 1430s by Italian mariner Andrea Bianco, but others found some of the similarities and differences very strange—the map cuts off Africa where Bianco's map has a page fold, but distorts shapes, and includes major revisions in the far east and west. The most surprising revision is that, unlike, for example, the famous Cantino World Map, the Vinland Map depicts Greenland as an island, remarkably close to the correct shape and orientation (while Norway, of which Greenland was just a colony, is wildly inaccurate) although contemporary Scandinavian accounts—including the work of Claudius Clavus in the 1420s—depict Greenland as a peninsula joined to northern Russia. For practical purposes, Arctic sea ice may have made this description true, and Greenland is not known to have been successfully circumnavigated until the 20th century. Skelton wondered also whether the revisions in the far east were meant to represent Japan—they seem to show not only Honshu, but also Hokkaido and Sakhalin, omitted even from Oriental maps in the 15th century.\n\nIn addition, the text uses a Latin form of Leif Ericson's name (\"Erissonius\") more consistent with 17th-century norms and with transmission through a French or Italian source. The Latin captions include several usages of the ligature æ; this was almost unknown in later medieval times (a simple e was written instead), and although the ligature was revived by Italian humanist scholars in the early 15th century, it is found only in documents of deliberately classicising humanist minuscule produced by Italian scribes, and never in conjunction with a Gothic style of script such as is seen in the map.\n\nAnother point calling the map's authenticity into question was raised at the 1966 Conference: that one caption referred to Bishop Eirik of Greenland \"and neighboring regions\" (in Latin, \"regionumque finitimarum\"), a title known previously from the work of religious scholar Luka Jelić [hr] (1864–1922). An essay by British researcher Peter Foote for the Saga Book of the Viking Society (vol. 11, part 1), published shortly after the conference, noted that German researcher Richard Hennig [de] (1874-1951) had spent years, before the Vinland Map was revealed, fruitlessly trying to track Jelić's phrase down in medieval texts. It seemed that either Jelić had seen the Vinland Map and promised not to reveal its existence (keeping the promise so rigidly that he never mentioned any of the other new historical information on the map), or that he had invented the phrase as a scholarly description, and the Vinland Map creator copied him. In practice, because Jelić's work had gone through three editions, Foote was able to demonstrate how the first edition (in French) had adopted the concept from the work of earlier researchers, listed by Jelić, then the later editions had adapted the anachronistic French scholarly phrase \"évèque régionnaire des contrées américaines\" into Latin.\n\nHandwriting experts at the 1966 Conference tended to disagree with Witten's assessment that the map captions had been written by the same person as the Speculum and Relation texts. This had also been a major reason why the British Museum had rejected the map in 1957, the Keeper of Manuscripts having detected elements of handwriting style not developed until the nineteenth century.[1]\n\nAnalysis of ink\nComplaints were made at the Conference that no scientist had been permitted to examine the map and its companion documents in all the years of study since 1957. Skelton's scientific colleagues at the British Museum made a short preliminary examination in 1967 and found that:\n\ndespite its appearance to the naked eye, the ink was certainly not conventional iron-gall ink like its two companion manuscripts, and indeed was unlike any recipe they had ever seen (they spent several months after the initial testing trying to find similar inks as far afield as Iceland);\nthe map outline appeared to consist of two superimposed lines, one black (but mostly vanished) which looked like graphite or soot, and one yellowish;\nthe whole of the map parchment (again, unlike its companions) had been coated or soaked in an unknown substance—they were not allowed to take a large enough sample to analyze it;\nthey could not be certain that the two halves of the map, held together by a binding strip glued on the back, had ever been a single sheet—unlike any other known medieval double-page map; looking at the map, it is clear that the artist knew exactly, to the nearest millimeter, where it was going to be folded, because several place-names start or finish right next to it while none are written straight across it, and the rivers of eastern Europe run parallel to it;\nthe rebinding of the Speculum volume without the map and Relation had used plastic thread, only available since about 1950.[5]\nIn 1972, with new technology becoming available, Yale sent the map for chemical analysis by forensic specialist Walter McCrone whose team, using a variety of techniques, found that the yellowish lines contain anatase (titanium dioxide) in a rounded crystalline form manufactured for use in pale pigments since the 1920s, indicating that the ink was modern. They also confirmed that the ink contained only trace amounts of iron, and that the black line remnants were on top of the yellow, indicating that they were not the remains of a penciled guide-line, as the British Museum staff had speculated.[6]\n\nA new investigation in the early 1980s, by a team under Thomas Cahill at the University of California, Davis, using Particle-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) found that only trace amounts (< 0.0062% by weight) of titanium appeared to be present in the ink,[7] which should have been too little for some of McCrone's analyses to detect.[8] The Cahill team acknowledged, however, that titanium was the only element within their technique's measurement capability which was significantly more concentrated in the ink than on the bare parchment (other elements such as iron and zinc were found concentrated in some inked samples, but only a minority). One member of the team, Gregory Möller, also analyzed loose particles retrieved from the split down the middle of the map by a different method, finding that most of them were rich in titanium (though a few black particles were rich in chromium and iron).[9] Because they were the first to apply PIXE to ink analysis, nobody at the time could explain the difference between the Cahill and McCrone figures. Attempting to reconcile the conflicting results, the Cahill team suggested that the high concentrations found by McCrone were due to a combination of contamination from modern dust, and poor sample selection (i.e. choosing contaminant particles like those in the split);[10] however, they also chose not to publish or publicise Möller's loose particle study.[11] The accumulation of large amounts of PIXE data from other laboratories around the world in the ensuing decades was sufficient by 2008 to show that the Cahill figures for all elements in the inks of the map and its companion documents are at least a thousand times too small,[12] so the discrepancy is due to a problem with their work.[13]\n\nThe McCrone team had also made mistakes, though none as fundamental as Cahill's. Revisiting his notes in 1987 to draft a detailed reply to the abbreviated public version of Cahill's report, Walter McCrone chose the wrong sample to illustrate a \"typical\" black ink particle, selecting one which had been found only loosely attached to the ink.[14] By focusing on this contamination, rich in chromium and iron, he gave Cahill the opportunity to re-emphasise his case in an essay for an expanded version of the 1965 official book, a few years later.\n\nIn 1991, McCrone, then director and senior research microscopist with the McCrone Research Institute, visited Yale to take new microsamples from the map, partly to check his earlier results, and partly to apply new techniques. Photomicrographs taken at 1 micrometer intervals through the thickness of ink samples demonstrated that the manufactured anatase particles were not just sticking to the surface as Cahill's criticisms had implied, and Fourier transform spectroscopy identified the ink's binder as gelatin, probably made from animal skin.[15] In July 2002, using Raman spectroscopy, the presence of significant quantities of anatase in the map ink was confirmed by British researchers Katherine Brown and Robin Clark, and the remaining traces of black pigment in the ink were found to consist essentially of soot-type carbon.[16]\n\nVarious scientists have formed their own theories to explain how the 20th century manufactured anatase in the Vinland Map ink could have got into genuine medieval ink. The first was chemist Jacqueline Olin, then a researcher with the Smithsonian Institution, who in the 1970s conducted experiments which produced anatase at an early stage of a medieval iron-gall ink production process. Examination of her anatase by a colleague, mineralogist Kenneth Towe, showed that it was very different from the neat, rounded crystals found in the Vinland Map and modern pigments.[8][17][18] Towe himself, a clay specialist, briefly considered the possibility that the anatase could have come from clay, where it is present in trace amounts, but on checking McCrone's data found no significant traces of clay minerals. Shortly before the Raman analysis was published, historian Douglas McNaughton based a mistaken theory about the ink around McCrone's emphasis on the chromium-rich black particle, having obtained unpublished data on the similar particles in Möller's report.[19]\n\nOlin published a paper that identifies the anatase in the Vinland Map ink as being truncated bi-pyramidal rather than rounded crystals [20] (however, this is not vastly different from the McCrones' 1974 description of the crystals as \"smooth, rounded rhomb shapes\"[6]).\n\nDating of parchment\nRadiocarbon dating, begun in 1995 by physicist Douglass Donahue and chemists Jacqueline Olin and Garman Harbottle, placed the origin of the parchment somewhere between 1423 and 1445. The initial results were confusing because the unknown substance the British Museum had found across the whole map, effectively ignored by later researchers who were concentrating on the ink, turned out to be trapping tiny traces of fallout deep within the parchment from 1950s nuclear tests. Although there was none of this 1950s substance on top of the ink, further tests, starting with a detailed chemical analysis, were needed to confirm whether the lines were drawn after it soaked into the parchment.[21]\n\nIn 2008, Harbottle's attempt to explain a possible medieval origin for the ink was published, but he was shown by Towe and others to have misunderstood the significance of the various analyses, rendering his theory meaningless.[13][16]\n\n\"VMTR 95\"\nThe expanded 30th anniversary edition of the 1965 official book, The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation, was notable for its exclusion of most of the evidence against the map's authenticity, concentrating instead on vindications by George Painter, and Thomas Cahill with colleague Bruce Kusko (in which they claimed specifically that they had not analyzed the loose particles they took from the map at the time of their PIXE research), but it did reprint an essay written in 1989 by the original book dealer Laurence Witten. He stated that, when the McCrone investigation concluded the map to be a forgery in 1974, he was asked by Yale to reveal its provenance as a matter of urgency, and to discuss the possible return of Mr Mellon's money. He replied that he had no idea where the map came from, beyond Ferrajoli (who was convicted of theft shortly after the sale, and died shortly after release from prison). On the subject of the money, he said he could not pay it all back because he had paid agreed shares of his profit to Ferrajoli and to another dealer who had introduced him. For his part, Mellon did not ask for the return of any money. The essay also revealed that Witten had, on Ferrajoli's recommendation, met with Irving Davis after buying the map volume in 1957.[22]\n\nRegardless of the controversy, the map, which had been valued for insurance purposes at over $750,000 in the 1960s, was claimed in 1996 to be worth $25,000,000.[23]\n\nMaps, Myths, and Men, 2004\nIn 2004, Kirsten A. Seaver published Maps, Myths, and Men: The Story of the Vinland Map, a wide-ranging review of the arguments and evidence presented to that date. Seaver was hailed as the Vinland map's \"most thorough and outspoken critic in recent years\" for her \"exemplary interdisciplinary study\".[24][25][26] She also theorized that the forger could have been Father Josef Fischer (1858-1944), an Austrian cartographer and Jesuit scholar. However, subsequent research into the provenance of the Vinland map documents (see below) suggests that they are unlikely to have spent any time in Fischer's possession.[27] Robert Baier, a forensic handwriting analyst, examined the map text and correspondence of Fischer, and his opinion was that \"they are not the same writer.\"[28]\n\nDanish investigation, 2005–2009\nIn 2005, a team from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, led by René Larsen, studied the map and its accompanying manuscripts to make recommendations on the best ways to preserve it.[29] Among other findings, this study confirmed that the two halves of the map were entirely separate, though they might have been joined in the past. A few months earlier, Kirsten Seaver had suggested that a forger could have found two separate blank leaves in the original \"Speculum Historiale\" volume, from which the first few dozen pages appeared to be missing, and joined them together with the binding strip.[1] On the other hand, at the International Conference on the History of Cartography in July 2009, Larsen revealed that his team had continued their investigation after publishing their original report, and he told the press that \"All the tests that we have done over the past five years — on the materials and other aspects — do not show any signs of forgery\".[30] The formal report of his presentation[31] showed that his work ignored rather than contradicted earlier studies. For example, he experimented only with artificial wormholes, and did not follow up the observation made at the 1966 Conference, that live bookworms were a known tool of the fake antiquities trade. Similarly, he claimed that the anatase in the ink could have come from sand used to dry it (the hypothetical source of the sand being gneiss from the Binnenthal area of Switzerland) but his team had not examined the crystals microscopically, and Kenneth Towe responded that this was an essential test, given that crystal size and shape should clearly distinguish commercial anatase from anatase found in sand.[32]\n\nMembers of the Danish team later joined with others to perform microanalyses of the remaining piece from the 1995 carbon dating sample. They found a significant quantity of monostearin (Glycerol monostearate) which is commonly used in the food and pharmaceutical industries, with additional aromatic compounds. It was thought that if it was not purely localised contamination from handling by somebody using something like hand lotion, it was likely to be the unidentified post-1950 chemical soaked into the parchment. Their microscopic examination confirmed that the parchment had been treated very roughly at some time, with 95% of fibres damaged.[33]\n\nA Sorry Saga, 2018\n\nIn June 2013, it was reported in the British press that a Scottish researcher, John Paul Floyd, claimed to have discovered two pre-1957 references to the Yale Speculum and Tartar Relation manuscripts which shed light on the provenance of the documents.[27][34] According to one of these sources (an exhibition catalogue), a 15th-century manuscript volume containing books 21-24 of the Speculum Historiale and C. de Bridia's Historia Tartarorum was lent by the Archdiocese of Zaragoza for display at the 1892-93 Exposición Histórico-Europea (an event held in Madrid, Spain to commemorate the voyages of Columbus).[35] Floyd noted that Spanish priest and scholar Cristóbal Pérez Pastor also reported having seen such a codex, in historical notes organised and published posthumously in 1926.[36] Neither the catalogue entry nor Pérez Pastor's description mentioned the presence of a map. It is known that Enzo Ferrajoli, who offered the Vinland manuscript for sale in 1957, was convicted of having stolen manuscripts from the Cathedral Library of La Seo, Zaragoza, in the 1950s.[37]\n\nSeparately, Floyd also observed that the creator of the Vinland Map had evidently made use of an 18th-century engraving of the 1436 Bianco map by Vincenzio Formaleoni (1752–97), since the Vinland Map reproduces several of Formaleoni's copying errors. He argued that this furnished a new and decisive proof that the map is inauthentic.[27][38]\n\nFloyd's book appeared in 2018 under the title, A Sorry Saga: Theft, Forgery, Scholarship... and the Vinland Map.[39]\n\nIdentification as a forgery, 2018\nAs controversy has swirled around the map almost since its acquisition, authorities at Yale University chose not to comment on the authenticity of the parchment document. In 2002, Yale librarian Alice Prochaska commented that \"We regard ourselves as the custodians of an extremely interesting and controversial document…and we watch the scholarly work on it with great interest.\"[40] However, in 2011, Yale's Chester D. Tripp Professor of History, Paul Freedman, did express his view that the map was \"unfortunately a fake\".[41]\n\nAt the 2018 Vinland Map Symposium, Yale conservation scientist Richard Hark revealed the results of new global chemical analyses of the Map and the Tartar Relation, which established, among many other things, that the ink lines of the Map contain varying amounts of anatase \"consistent with modern manufacture\". So too do two small patches on the first page of the Tartar Relation, where the original iron-gall ink appears to have been erased and replaced.[42]\n\nRaymond Clemens, Curator of Early Books and Manuscripts at Yale's Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, considers that the latest historical and scientific research proves \"beyond a doubt\" that the Vinland map \"was a forgery, not a medieval product as it claimed to be.\" In a March 2019 article, Clemens highlights the fact that \"historical investigations by John Paul Floyd have revealed that the Vinland Map is actually based not on Bianco’s 1436 map, but on a printed facsimile map made in 1782. Floyd discovered this by noting mistakes in the 1782 map that were replicated on the Vinland map, but could be found nowhere else.\" Furthermore, the map has been studied at the Beinecke Library using new technology. \"In the case of the Vinland map we were able to prove... [the map] was clearly a 20th century fake.\" Despite the reveal of the map's forged origins, Clemens stated that the map would remain at the Beinecke Library, as it had \"become an historical object in and of itself.\"[43][44][45]\n",

He stated that, when the McCrone investigation concluded the map to be a forgery in 1974, he was asked by Yale to reveal its provenance as a matter of urgency, and to discuss the possible return of Mr Mellon's money. He replied that he had no idea where the map came from, beyond Ferrajoli (who was convicted of theft shortly after the sale, and died shortly after release from prison). On the subject of the money, he said he could not pay it all back because he had paid agreed shares of his profit to Ferrajoli and to another dealer who had introduced him. For his part, Mellon did not ask for the return of any money. The essay also revealed that Witten had, on Ferrajoli's recommendation, met with Irving Davis after buying the map volume in 1957.",

[the map] was clearly a 20th century fake.\" Despite the reveal of the map's forged origins, Clemens stated that the map would remain at the Beinecke Library, as it had \"become an historical object in and of itself.\"",

        "Document description": "The Zeno brothers, Nicolò (c. 1326 – c. 1402) and Antonio (died c. 1403), were Italian noblemen from the Republic of Venice who lived during the 14th century. They came to prominence in 1558, when their descendant, Nicolò Zeno the Younger, published a map and a series of letters purporting to describe an exploration made by the brothers of the north Atlantic and Arctic waters in the 1390s. The younger Nicolò claimed the documents were discovered in a storeroom of his family home.\n\nWidely accepted at the time of publication, the map was incorporated into the works of leading cartographers, including Gerardus Mercator. Modern historians and geographers have disputed the veracity of the map and the described voyages, with some accusing the younger Zeno of forgery. \n\nNicolò and Antonio were brothers of the Venetian naval hero Carlo Zeno. The Zeno family was an established part of the aristocracy of Venice and held the franchise for transportation between Venice and the Holy Land during the Crusades. According to the younger Zeno, the map and letters date from around the year 1400 and describe a long voyage made by the Zeno brothers in the 1390s under the direction of a prince named Zichmni.  Supporters of a legend involving the contemporaneous Scottish nobleman Henry Sinclair, Earl of Orkney suggest that Zichmni is a mistranscription of d’Orkney. The voyage supposedly traversed the North Atlantic and, according to some interpretations, reached North America nearly a century before the voyages of Christopher Columbus.",
        "Document claims": "The account of the voyages given by the younger Nicolò continues to attract debate. Some of the islands the Zeno brothers allegedly visited either conflate existing locations or do not exist at all.   Research has shown that the Zeno brothers were occupied elsewhere when they were supposedly doing their exploring.  Contemporary Venetian court documents place Nicolò as undergoing trial for embezzlement in 1394 for his actions as military governor of Modone and Corone in Greece from 1390–1392. He wrote his last will and testament in Venice in 1400, many years after his alleged death in Frislanda around 1394. There is disagreement about the brothers' whereabouts at the time of the supposed voyages, with some readings of archival records placing the brothers in Venice at that time. Andrea di Robilant suggests this interpretation is in error.\n\nAccording to The Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online, \"the Zeno affair remains one of the most preposterous and at the same time one of the most successful fabrications in the history of exploration.\"  Herbert Wrigley Wilson described and analysed the story at length in The Royal Navy, a History from the Earliest Times to the Present, and was sceptical about its veracity, noting \"At the date when the work was published Venice was extremely eager to claim for herself some share in the credit of Columbus's discoveries as against her old rival Genoa, from whom Columbus had sprung.\"  Di Robilant disagrees, stating that the younger Nicolò was \"a first-class muddler, not a fablemonger\", whose inaccuracy was the result of second-hand retelling that still contains much of the truth of his forebears' voyages. : 194 \n\nModern views\nMost historians regard the map and accompanying narrative as a hoax,  perpetrated by the younger Zeno to make a retroactive claim for Venice as having discovered the New World before Christopher Columbus.\n\nThe evidence against the authenticity of the map is based largely on the appearance of many phantom islands in the North Atlantic and off the coast of Iceland.   One of these non-existent islands was Frisland, where the Zeno brothers allegedly spent some time.\n\nCurrent scholarship regards the map as being based on existing maps of the 16th century, in particular:\n\nThe Olaus Magnus map of the North, the Carta marina\nThe Caerte van Oostland of Cornelis Anthoniszoon\nClaudius Clavus-type maps of the North",

        "Document description": "The Book of Jasher, also called Pseudo-Jasher, is an eighteenth-century literary forgery by Jacob Ilive.  It purports to be an English translation by Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus of the lost Book of Jasher. It is sometimes called Pseudo-Jasher to distinguish it from the midrashic Sefer haYashar (Book of the Upright, Naples, 1552), which incorporates genuine Jewish legend.\n\nDetails\nPublished in November 1750, the title page of the book says: \"translated into English by Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus, of Britain, Abbot of Canterbury, who went on a pilgrimage into the Holy Land and Persia, where he discovered this volume in the city of Gazna.\" The book claims to be written by Jasher, son of Caleb, one of Moses's lieutenants, who later judged Israel at Shiloh. The book covers biblical history from the creation down to Jasher's own day and was represented as the Lost Book of Jasher mentioned in the Bible.\n\nThe Book of Jasher contained naturalistic explanations for the miracles of the Old Testament. \n\nThe provenance of the text was immediately suspect: the eighth-century cleric Alcuin could not have produced a translation in the English of the King James Bible. There is an introductory account by Alcuin of his discovery of the manuscript in Persia and its history since the time of Jasher, and a commendation by John Wycliffe.",
        "Document claims": "The supposed lost book was declared an obvious hoax by the Monthly Review in the December of the year of publication.\n\nThe printer Jacob Ilive was sentenced in 1756 to three years' imprisonment with hard labour in the House of Correction at Clerkenwell, for writing, printing, and publishing the anonymous pamphlet Some Remarks on the excellent Discourses lately published by a very worthy Prelate by a Searcher after Religious Truth (1754). The pamphlet was declared to be \"a most blasphemous book\", for denying the divinity of Jesus Christ and revealed religion. Ilive remained in gaol until 1758, spending time writing.[3]\n\nIn 1829, a slightly revised and enlarged edition of the Book of Jasher was published in Bristol, provoking attacks against it. Photographic reproduction of this 1829 edition was published in 1934 by the Rosicrucians in San Jose, California,[4] who declared it an inspired work.",

The book refers to supposed events, the earliest of which would, if real, be datable to around the 7th century BC while the latest would have occurred around the 9th century AD.\n\nThe book was allegedly discovered in 1919 and lost in 1941. It is widely believed by scholars to be a forgery made in the 1940s–1950s, or less likely, in the early 19th century. The most decisive evidence for this is the language of the text, which is a mixture of different modern Slavic languages, with erroneous and invented linguistic forms and no regular grammar. Moreover, different modern editions of the book have different versions of the text. Regardless, some Slavic neopagans use it as a sacred text.",
        "Document claims": "Most of the scholars that specialize in the field of mythological studies and Slavic linguistics (such as Boris Rybakov, Andrey Zaliznyak, Leo Klejn, and all Russian academic historians and linguists) consider it a forgery.[4] According to these scholars the thorough analysis of the book shows that it was written sometime in the 20th century. The history of the book can be reliably traced only as far as mid-1950s, when the transcribed book and the photograph of one of the planks first appeared in a San Francisco-based, Russian émigré newspaper. Several scholars believe that the entire book is a product of collaboration of the editors of this newspaper and Yuriy Mirolyubov, who later claimed to have found the book. Others believe that either the entire book or the only plank available, were forged in the early 19th century by the Russian collector and forger Alexander Sulakadzev.\n\nThe book is written in a language using for the most part Slavic roots and different affixes found also in old East Slavic. Consequently, a large part of the book's text, once transcribed into a modern alphabet, is readable (albeit with some difficulty) by modern speakers of Slavic languages. However, professional linguists and historians, particularly the specialists in ancient Slavic, question many features of its language — vocabulary (modern or medieval Slavic words occasionally and unwittingly used in place of their ancient equivalents), spelling, phonetics (distinct reflections of the nasal vowels, both following Polish and Serbian patterns in different places, the haphazard handling of reduced vowels, etc., etc.), grammar (grammatical forms incompatible with early Slavic languages, combinations of affixes that contradict each other in meaning), etc. These features seem to indicate that the text was artificially \"aged\" by someone with superficial knowledge of ancient Slavic, and cannot be adequately translated because of lack of any consistent grammar system. In the words of the philologist O.V. Tvorogov:\n\nThis analysis leads us to a definite conclusion: we are dealing with an artificial language, \"invented\" by a person unacquainted with the history of Slavic languages and one who could not create his own language system.\n\n— [5]\nIn Ukraine, whereas academic scholars agree that the book is a hoax, it became very popular among politicians who consider it genuine and believe it describes real historical facts relevant for establishing Ukrainian ethnicity. In particular, Levko Lukyanenko cited the Book of Veles as historical.[citation needed] In 1999, the book was included in the high school program in Ukraine as a genuine literary and historical piece.[6]",

        "Document description": "Brain-Washing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics is a Red Scare, black propaganda book, published by the Church of Scientology in 1955 about brainwashing. L. Ron Hubbard authored the text and alleged it was the secret manual written by Lavrentiy Beria, the Soviet secret police chief, in 1936.  In this text, many of the practices Scientology opposes (psychiatry teaching, brain surgery, electroshock, income tax) are described as Communist-led conspiracies, and its technical content is limited to suggesting more of these practices on behalf of the Soviet Union. The text also describes the Church of Scientology as the greatest threat to Communism.\n\nHubbard's text is a relative copy of the 1953, best-selling, non-fiction book Brain-washing in Red China by journalist Edward Hunter.  This text is also listed in They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes..., where the true author is identified as \"the notorious founder of Scientology.\"  Hubbard sent the material to the FBI, and one unidentified FBI agent gave this review: \"[He] appears mental.\"  When the FBI ignored him, Hubbard wrote again stating that Soviet agents had, on three occasions, attempted to hire him to work against the United States, and were upset about his refusal,  and that one agent specifically attacked him using electroshock as a weapon. ",
        "Document claims": "An example of this generalized style can be found in chapter 6, where a relatively uninformed technique of control is described as...\n\n\"As an example of this, we find an individual refusing to obey and being struck. His refusal to obey is now less vociferous. He is struck again, and his resistance is lessened once more. He is hammered and pounded again and again, until, at length, his only thought is direct and implicit obedience to that person from whom the force has emanated.\"[18]\n\nAccording to the journalist Tony Ortega, the primary thesis of the work was \"how to use psychiatry and psychology to carry out a communist takeover of the West,\" with critics and active communists calling it a \"crude and laughable forgery,\" and Edward Hunter, author of Brainwashing In China, \"described it as a fictional and inferior version of his own [book].\"[2]\n\nThe book has the Communist Beria allegedly using obvious phrases that were clearly invented by L. Ron Hubbard, such as \"thinkingness,\" \"pain-drug-hypnosis,\", or \"psycho-political technology\" (i.e. \"religious technology\"), and making an unlikely mention of Dianetics side by side with Christian Science and Catholicism as major worldwide \"healing groups\". Modern versions of the book do not include these Hubbardisms.[20][21] Nick Redfern, a researcher studying Freedom of Information Act requests and FBI files, has written \"the document [the brain-washing manual] is filled with what is clearly evidence of Hubbard's own writing style.\"[22]\n\nIn this 1955 text, the alleged author states that income tax is \"a Marxist principle smoothly slid into Capitalistic framework in 1909 in the United States,\"[17] and in 1956, only a year later, L. Ron Hubbard wrote a rather similar statement under his own name, saying that mankind was so desperate that he \"will buy almost any ideology whether it is communism or druidism. He will buy the garbage of Marx and even write it unsuspectingly into the United States Constitution under the heading of 'Income Tax.' He will seek solutions to his overpowering problems from indigestible sources such as Russian psychiatry or Wundtian German psychology, neither one of which was intended to free Man or to give him understanding and which were intended only to enslave and debase.\"[23]\n\nThe final results of a 1965 Australian investigation called the Anderson Report declared:\n\n\"The Board is not concerned to find that the scientology techniques are brainwashing techniques as practised, so it is understood, in some communist-controlled countries. Scientology techniques are, nevertheless, a kind of brainwashing ... The astonishing feature of Scientology is that its techniques and propagation resemble very closely those set out in a book entitled Brain-washing, advertised and sold by the [Hubbard Association of Scientologists International].\"[9]",

        "Document description": "The William Lynch speech, also known as the Willie Lynch letter, is an address purportedly delivered by a William Lynch (or Willie Lynch) to an audience on the bank of the James River in Virginia in 1712 regarding control of slaves within the colony.  In recent years, it has been widely exposed as a hoax.  \n\nThe letter purports to be a verbatim account of a short speech given by a slave owner, in which he tells other slave masters that he has discovered the \"secret\" to controlling black slaves by setting them against one another. The document has been in print since at least 1970, but first gained widespread notice in the 1990s, when it appeared on the Internet.  Since then, it has often been promoted as an authentic account of slavery during the 18th century, though its inaccuracies and anachronisms have led historians to conclude that it is a hoax.  ",
        "Document claims": "The reputed author, William Lynch, identifies himself as the master of a \"modest plantation\" in the British West Indies who has been summoned to the Virginia Colony by local slaveowners to advise them on problems they have been having in managing their slaves.\n\nHe briefly notes that their current violent method of handling unruly slaves – lynching, though the term is not used – is inefficient and counterproductive. Instead, he suggests that they adopt his method, which consists of exploiting differences such as age and skin color in order to pit slaves against each other. This method, he assures his hosts, will \"control the slaves for at least three hundred [sic] years.\"[1] Some online versions of the text attach introductions, such as a foreword attributed to Frederick Douglass, or citations falsely giving Lynch's name as the source of the word \"lynching\".[4]\n\nThe text of the speech has been published since at least 1970,[4] and is often published with the title \"The Making of a Slave\".[6][7][8] It appeared on the Internet as early as 1993, when a reference librarian at the University of Missouri–St. Louis posted the document on the library's Gopher server.[9] The librarian later revealed that she had obtained the document from the publisher of a local annual business directory, The St. Louis Black Pages[10] in which the narrative had recently appeared.[9]\n\nThough eventually convinced the document was a forgery, the librarian elected to leave it on the Gopher server, as she believed that \"even as an inauthentic document, it says something about the former and current state of African America\", but added a warning about its provenance.[9]\n\nThe text contains numerous anachronisms, including words and phrases such as \"refueling\" and \"fool proof\" which were not in use until the early 20th century,[5] while historian Roy Rosenzweig noted the divisions emphasized in the text – skin color, age, and gender – are distinctly 20th-century in nature, making little sense in an 18th-century context.[4] Historians, including Rosenzweig and William Jelani Cobb, have concluded that the William Lynch speech is a modern hoax.[4][5]",

        "Document description": "The Code of Rajah Kalantiaw was a supposed legal code in the epic history Maragtas that is said to have been written in 1433 by Datu Kalantiaw, a chief on the island of Negros in the Philippines. It is now generally accepted by historians that the documents supporting the existence and history of the code, according to some sources, “appear to be deliberate fabrications with no historical validity\" written in 1913 by a scholar named Jose Marco as a part of a historical fiction titled Las antiguas leyendas de la Isla de Negros (English: The Ancient Legends of the Island of Negros).  \n\nIn 1990, Philippine historian Teodoro Agoncillo described the code as \"a disputed document.\"  Despite doubts on its authenticity, some history textbooks continue to present it as historical fact.  In 2005, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines officially recognized Kalantiaw and the Code of Kalantiaw to be a 20th-century fraudulent work by José Marco with no historical basis. ",
        "Document claims": "Jose Marco wrote about the Code of Kalantiaw in his 1917 book Historia Prehispana de Filipinas (\"Prehispanic History of the Philippines\") where he moved the location of the Code's origin from Negros to the Panay province of Aklan because he suspected that it may be related to the Ati-atihan festival. Other authors throughout the 20th century gave credence to the story and the code.\n\nIt first gained scholarly acceptance when Marco donated five manuscripts of the fraudulent documents to the American historian James Alexander Robertson. Robertson presented it in San Francisco in 1915 in a paper entitled Social structure of, and ideas of law among early Philippine peoples, in a recently discovered pre-Hispanic criminal code of the Philippine Islands. Robertson was a notable proponent of Anti-Spanish \"black legend\" propaganda and had also deliberately distorted translations of Spanish documents of the Philippines in the compilation The Philippine Islands, 1493–1898 (1903–1907) co-authored with Emma Helen Blair.[6]\n\nIn 1965, then University of Santo Tomas doctoral candidate William Henry Scott began an examination of pre-hispanic sources for the study of Philippine history. Scott eventually demonstrated that the code was a forgery committed by Marco. When Scott presented these conclusions in his doctoral dissertation, defended on 16 June 1968 before a panel of eminent Filipino historians which included Teodoro Agoncillo, Horacio de la Costa, Marcelino Foronda, Mercedes Grau Santamaria, Nicolas Zafra and Gregorio Zaide, not a single question was raised about the chapter which he had called The Contributions of Jose E. Marco to Philippine historiography. However, in 1971 a decoration to be known as the Order of Kalantiao was created, to be awarded to any citizen of the Philippines for exceptional and meritorious services to the Republic in the administration of justice and in the field of law.[7]\n\nScott later published his findings debunking the code in his book Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine History.[8] Filipino historians later removed the code from future literature regarding Philippine history.[9] When Antonio M. Molina published a Spanish version of his The Philippines Through the Centuries as Historia de Filipinas (Madrid, 1984),[10] he replaced the Code with one sentence: La tesis doctoral del historador Scott desbarata la existencia misma de dicho Código. (\"The doctoral dissertation of the historian Scott demolishes the very existence of the Code\").[11]\n\nThe authenticity of the code had been questioned previously by other scholars,[13] However, despite this and despite Scott's findings, changes in textbooks and in academic curriculum were not forthcoming until almost thirty years following the release of Scott's publication in 1969. In the interim, the Code of Kalantiaw continued to be taught as a part of ancient Philippine history.[14]\n\nIn 2004, National Historical Institute (NHI) Resolution No. 12 \"[declaring that Code of Kalantiao/Kalantiaw has no valid historical basis\" called for: (1) the official affirmation that the Kalantiaw Code is a twentieth-century fraudulent work by Jose Marco, (2) the President of the Philippines cease to honor retiring Supreme justices and other international dignitaries with the ‘Order of Kalantiaw’, and (3) the revoking of Executive Order 234, which recognized Datu Bondahara Kalantiaw as \"The First Philippine Lawgiver\" and declared a Hall of Fame and Library to be constructed in his honor in Batan, Aklan as a national shrine.[15] This NHI resolution was approved by the Office of the President in 2005.[5]",

        "Document description": "The Dvůr Králové and Zelená Hora manuscripts (Czech: Rukopis královédvorský, RK, and Rukopis zelenohorský, RZ[a], German: Königinhofer Handschrift and Grünberger Handschrift) are literary hoaxes purporting to be epic Slavic manuscripts written in Old Czech. They first appeared in the early 19th century.\n\n",
        "Document claims": "When the first manuscript appeared, it was touted as a major discovery. But when the second manuscript appeared, it was pronounced a forgery by Josef Dobrovský. Jernej Kopitar seconded this opinion, accusing Hanka of being the author of the hoax.    Many of the important Czech writers at the time, however, supported the manuscripts' authenticity including dictionary compiler and author of a Czech literary history Josef Jungmann, writer František Čelakovský, historian František Palacký, and poet-folklorist Karel Jaromír Erben.  \n\nIn England, John Bowring, who was a translator of Slavonic poetry, had dealings with authorities on both sides of the debate. When he first sought suitable Czech material, he approached Kopitar, who recommended Dobrovský as someone who could provide an appropriate list of texts. Later, Čelakovský learned of this enterprise, and not only furnished his own list, but became Bowring's close collaborator, sending him material with his own German paraphrases for Bowring to work on.  Bowring, partly to make amends for the delayed publication of the Czech poetry anthology, wrote a piece in the Foreign Quarterly Review in 1828, which presented the debate about these manuscripts evenly for both sides.[f] \n\nWratislaw noted in his 1852 translation that he was well aware of the controversy when he published his translation, but determined that the skeptics had not made their case. \n\nAlois Vojtěch Šembera wrote a book in 1879 which contended that the \"Libušin soud\" poem (the second manuscript) was a forgery and named Josef Linda [cz] as its creator. \n\nThe authenticity of both manuscripts was not rejected conclusively until the 1880s when several independently-written articles appeared that assaulted their veracity.  One author who doubted the authenticity of the manuscripts, Tomáš Masaryk,  used his journal Athenaeum to publish a body of literature to support that view.    The linguist Jan Gebauer wrote an article debunking the manuscripts in the February 1886 issue of Athenaeum,   and Masaryk in a later issue wrote that the poems could be proven as \"reworked from Modern Czech to Old Czech\", presenting metrical and grammatical evidence to support his claim.  \n\nIn the interim, the manuscripts were generally regarded romantically as evidence of early Czech literary achievement, demonstrating that such epic and lyric poetry predated even the Nibelungenlied. They were also interpreted as evidence that early Czech society had embraced democratic principles. Pan-Slavic nationalists saw in the manuscripts a symbol of national conscience. Therefore, when Palacký wrote his Czech history based partly on these manuscripts, he depicted a romanticized Slavic struggle against the German non-democratic social order.  Palacký's historical accounts of Bohemia based on the manuscripts also bolstered the Czechs' exclusive claims on Bohemia.[citation needed]\n\nThe debate over the authenticity and authorship of these manuscripts has occupied Czech politics for more than a century, and voices claiming the poems to be genuine were not silenced even into World War II. \n\nVáclav Hanka, the discoverer of the first manuscript, and his friend and roommate Josef Linda are generally regarded to have been the forgers of the poetry, but they never confessed to writing them, and there has not been any irrefutable proof that they were the authors.

        "Document description": "The Mathilde Lefebvre letter (French: lettre de Mathilde Lefebvre) is a hoax document found in a bottle, purportedly written by Mathilde Lefebvre, a young girl from Liévin, France who died in the sinking of the Titanic, but in fact was forged by an anonymous forger.\n\nIn the spring of 2021, the French newspaper La Voix du Nord published an article entitled “Qui était Franck Lefebvre, l’Haillicourtois qui a perdu une partie de sa famille dans le naufrage du Titanic ?” (in French, Who was Franck Lefebvre, the Hailourtois who lost part of his family in the sinking of the Titanic ?) mentioning this document. After that, there were media reports about the letter. After several specialists had expressed doubts about the authenticity of the letter, it was revealed that it was a hoax.",
        "Document claims": "First doubts\nVery quickly, several specialists expressed doubts about the authenticity of the letter. Several points intrigue researchers, both in terms of the condition of the message and the message itself.\n\nHandwriting\nAccording to Franck Gavard-Perret, professor of geography history and Nicolas Beaudry, from the Uqar Archaeology and Heritage Laboratory, the handwriting attributed to Mathilde Lefebvre isn't like that expected from people of the working classes of the time, especially when compared with the correspondence of the Poilu of the Great War.[7][19][20] Psychomotrician Coraline Hausenblas conducted a study of writing and concluded that “identity theft was carried out in order to carry out a hoax around a historical subject attracting the attention and sympathy of the public”.[21] Several forms of writing had been used: cursive writing, but also script, common in the Anglo-Saxon world, but not in France[22] · .[23]\n\nThe text\nThe text does not contain much personal information, making it difficult to determine its authenticity. In the letter, Mathilde asks that anyone who finds her notify the Lefebvre family to Liévin. But Mathilde, her mother and her siblings were the last members of her family to leave Liévin to join the father of a family already settled in the United States. Why would she want a finder to contact the Lefebvre family in Liévin, when they no longer had close family there? Why, if she wanted to be contacted herself that her message had been found, didn’t she ask to send the letter to her destination, Mystic, Iowa?\n\nAccording to Antoine Resche, this can be explained as follows: “If we start from the premise that the document is a forgery, it is very easy to explain: it is much more common to find the city of origin of the Lefebvre's Family than their destination...and a forger did not necessarily have this information”.[7]\n\nThe bottle\nThe bottle used to convey the message is a small glass bottle, intended for liquors or perfumes. It is known that third class passengers often travelled with little luggage: such an empty bottle would therefore have had little room in the Lefebvre's luggage, which had to be limited to the essentials. According to Antoine Resche, \"Such bottles would certainly not have been available in the third class dining room, which did not offer self-service liquors. A lone mother traveling with children who did not speak English would also have had a difficult time obtaining them from the crew\".[7] Although researchers have stated that the bottle is “consistent with the early 20th century. You can find vintage bottles in an apothecary's shop, but that doesn't ensure that it was discarded in 1912.”[8]\n\nWax\nThe bottle was supposed to have been in the water for over a century. In order for the message not to be affected by moisture, a very generous amount of wax would have had to be applied to the neck. It is difficult to explain how Mathilde could have obtained so much wax on board.[7]\n\nThe place where the bottle was found\nThe bottle was found stranded in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick.[9][11] According to ocean current specialists, if such a drift from the site of the sinking was not impossible, it remains highly improbable.[8][24][23] This improbability must therefore be coupled with all the other improbabilities mentioned above.[7]\n\nAftermath\nIn order to be able to prove with certainty that the recovered letter was indeed written by Mathilde Lefebvre, it would be necessary to have authentic elements of Mathilde Lefebvre’s handwriting in order to compare.[25][26] However, there are no known samples of his handwriting.[7]\n\nIn the end, newspapers such as Le Point and several others have admitted that Mathilde Lefebvre's letter was a hoax.[27]\n\nThe only consequence was to give visibility to a family involved in the Titanic disaster that until then had been little known.[28][29]",

        "Document claims": "1957 claim\nDuring 1957 a mother and daughter (Amalia and Rosa Panvini) produced thirty volumes of what they later claimed were Mussolini's diaries; these diaries apparently fooled the dictator's son and an expert.[1] At first it was believed that the large number of volumes in themselves were evidence that they were not forgeries; it was later discovered that these diaries had in fact been forged.\n\n2007 claim\nIn February 2007, Italian senator Marcello Dell'Utri claimed that diaries, covering the years from 1935 to 1939 had been found.[2] Moreover, he claimed in the newspaper Corriere della Sera, these Mussolini diaries were with a lawyer at Bellinzona, in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland. He said he examined the diaries and found that the \"handwriting is clear and recognisably\" that of Mussolini, though \"a bit hurried\". Dell'Utri stated that his claim was supported by an unknown handwriting expert. He said further that the diaries had been found in a suitcase the dictator was carrying when he was caught by partisans in Dongo, at Lake Como, while he was fleeing to Switzerland in April 1945. The books had been hidden by one of the partisans who had died recently.\n\nThese diaries generated much interest among historians, as it appeared that Mussolini reluctantly brought Italy into World War II and that he had tried to prevent the war. The diaries were also received with scepticism as they had not been authenticated independently. This scepticism was made more acute by memories of the 1957 forgery and the forged Hitler diaries case in 1983.\n\nLater in February two Italian historians, Emilio Gentile and Roberto Travaglini, independently discovered that these diaries had indeed been forged.[3] The historians claimed that these diaries had been around for some time and that someone had tried to sell them to journalists, auction houses and publishing houses before offering them to Dell'Utri: they had already been offered to The Times in 1980, to Sotheby's in 1990, to Feltrinelli in 1992 and to L'Espresso in 2004, all of which rejected them as forgeries. According to Gentile, the diaries contain \"historical errors\" and that the authors \"seem to have copied various articles from old newspapers\", and according to Travaglini \"there were too many elements that did not match up\".\n\nDell'Utri is the owner of the diaries and still claims them to be authentic. Then-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who is a close friend to Dell'Utri, also claimed that they are authentic and went so far to quote them in a 2010 OSCE meeting in Paris.[4] Several elements close to Berlusconi, such as editor Elisabetta Sgarbi or the right-wing newspaper Libero (which distributed copies of the books to its readers in 2011), have also tried to defend the authenticity of the diaries, despite scholarly agreement that they are a forgery.[5]",

        "Document description": "My Sister and I is an apocryphal work attributed to the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Following the Nietzsche scholar Walter Kaufmann, most consider the work to be a literary forgery,    although a small minority argues for the book's authenticity. \n\nIt was supposedly written in 1889 or early 1890 during Nietzsche's stay in a mental asylum in the Thuringian city of Jena. If legitimate, My Sister and I would be Nietzsche's second autobiographical and final overall work, chronologically following his Wahnbriefe (Madness Letters), written during his extended time of mental collapse. My Sister and I makes several bold and otherwise unreported biographical claims, most notably of an incestuous relationship between Nietzsche and his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, as well as an affair with Richard Wagner's wife Cosima. It is written in a style that combines anecdote and aphorism in a manner similar to other Nietzsche works.",
        "Document claims": "Nietzsche scholars in general adopted the opinion of Kaufmann, who immediately identified the book as a forgery in a 1952 article.[1] Evidence against the book cited both by Kaufmann and later commentators includes anachronisms, such as a reference to an 1898 incident, incongruous references to Marxism, and the city of Detroit (globally unknown in the late 19th century), along with a seemingly poor grasp of philosophy, and sexualized pulpy content.[1][3] Kaufmann also notes instances of clever wordplay in the English text that are impossible to express as such in the German language.\n\nSince the only copy of this alleged work is in English, and there is not a single page of what would have been his original in German, opinion has been largely that the work is a forgery.\n\nNevertheless, a minority hold the work to be authentic. Beginning in the mid-1980s, a handful of articles began to call for its reevaluation, including references to more recently-discovered journals and letters from Nietzsche and Cosima Wagner. Amok Books' 1990 edition reprints many secondary articles on the subject, and includes an original introduction calling for a reevaluation of the book. Nietzsche scholar Walter K. Stewart, in his 185-page monograph Nietzsche: My Sister and I — A Critical Study published in 2007, argues for the original's potential legitimacy by conducting a point-by-point analysis of Kaufmann's book review.[4] In his 2011 followup, Friedrich Nietzsche My Sister and I: Investigation, Analysis, Interpretation, Stewart uses direct textual analysis to argue that whoever wrote My Sister and I was intimate with every aspect of Nietzsche’s life and perspective.",

        "Document description": "The discovery of an Old High German lullaby (Althochdeutsches Schlummerlied) was announced in 1859 by Georg Zappert (1806–1859) of Vienna, a private scholar and collector of medieval literature. Ostensibly a 10th-century poem full of surviving pre-Christian mythology, it is considered a literary forgery of Zappert's by many experts who have commented on it.\n\n",
        "Document claims": "Authenticity debate\nIf authentic, the text would afford a rich source for Germanic paganism, giving more detail on the deities mentioned even than the Merseburg Incantations (discovered 1841). Johann Kelle (1860) [1] had scathing criticism for Zappert's analysis, disagreeing with literally every one of Zappert's conclusions and emendations, but did not question the authenticity of the document. Jacob Grimm in Berliner Sitzungsberichte, 1859, 254—58 refers to Zappert's publication as an independent attestation of the name Zanfana, apparently without doubting its authenticity. In fact, Edwards (2002, p. 150) [2] claims that J. Grimm intended to publish a defence of the lullaby, and “stood out from the beginning because of his enthusiastic advocacy of the lullaby”.\n\nBut Grohmann (1861) [3] in a 46-page essay examines the poem in detail and concludes that it is clearly a falsification. Since Zappert had died in 1859, he could not defend his position.\n\nKletke (1867) [4] still considers the text genuine, but the mainstream opinion in the late 19th century and until today remains Grohmann's. Nevertheless, there have been a few 20th-century scholars defending the poem's authenticity (see Diamant 1960 [5], Howard 1976) [6].\n\nFichtenau (1970) again concludes that without a doubt, the poem is a falsification. Edwards (2002, p. 158) [7] states that from six essays which appeared on the topic of the lullaby during the 20th century, three consider it a forgery, while three declare it as genuine. Edwards himself (p. 161) [8] concludes that the evidence adduced in his essay against the authenticity of the lullaby “points more than one finger of suspicion, but falls short of certainty”.\n\nArguments in favour of the authenticity:\n\nHoward (1976, p. 34) [9] argues that the text presupposes some linguistic knowledge which could not have been available to Zappert at the time. He specifically mentions the spelling of the sound e in uuerit with the Hebrew Zeire, which represents a closed /e/-sound. According to Howard, scholars at the time regarded the /e/-sound from i-mutation as open, and a forger would therefore have chosen the Hebrew Segol instead of Zeire.\nArguments against the authenticity:\n\nAccording to Fichtenau (1970), [10] Zappert is suspected of having produced other forgeries, too. The text of one of them, an old map of Vienna, shows some striking paleographical similarities to the Old High German lullaby (Edwards 2002, p. 156) [11].\nAccording to Edwards (p. 160f.), [12] F. Mairinger has investigated the ink of the lullaby and the Hebrew line and concluded that unlike the remaining Hebrew words, they were not executed “in the typical medieval 'Eisengallentinte' with soot admixture”. This points to a forgery. (The parchment and the Hebrew pen trials appear to be medieval, though).\nIt is known that the unusual link between Germanic and Hebrew culture manifested by the writing on this piece of parchment was a topic “dear to Zappert's heart” (Edwards 2002, p. 160) [13], being of Jewish origin himself, and this could have provided a motive for a forgery.\nThe information given about heathen gods in the lullaby curiously matches some passages in J. Grimm's book Deutsche Mythologie (first published in 1835), where Grimm lamented a lack of sources. This suggests that “Zappert looked for holes in Grimm's Deutsche Mythologie, and sought to plug them.” (Edwards 2002, p. 157) [14].",

The document's supposed authors, the \"Israelite International League\", gloat over their success at reducing the Russian people to \"helpless slaves\", and urge their fellow Jews to \"excite hatred\" and \"buy up Government loans and gold\", in order to grow in \"political and economic power and influence\". The text has been cited, as with other antisemitic canards, as evidence for the antisemitic belief that the Jews are conspiring to take over the world.\n\n",
        "Document claims": "History\nA Protocol of 1919 was first published in the Estonian newspaper Postimees (morning edition) on 31 December 1919. Postimees detailed how the originally Hebrew text was found from the pocket of Shunderev, a Jewish Bolshevik battalion commander in the 11th Rifle Regiment who had been killed in action on the night before 9 December.[2] At the time, Postimees was owned by Jaan Tõnisson, an Estonian nationalist politician.\n\nThe text appeared next on 5 February 1920 in Prizyv, a Russian newspaper in Berlin. Prizvy described it as \"an interesting document\". Later it was reproduced in the appendix of a greatly expanded English-language edition of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, published in 1934 by the Patriotic Publishing Co., operating from a post office box in Chicago, Illinois.[3]\n\nWalter Laqueur, an American historian, states that \"the German right-wing extremist press was supplied for years with information first published in Prizyv during its nine months of existence\", and points to A Protocol of 1919 as a \"typical\" example.[4]\n\nContent\nThe document consists of eleven short paragraphs of vague antisemitic generalizations, with eight admonitions to be \"careful\" or \"cautious\", and is signed by \"The Central Committee of the Petersburg Branch of the Israelite International League\".",

        "Document description": "The Report from Iron Mountain is a book published in 1967 (during the Johnson Administration) by Dial Press which puts itself forth as the report of a government panel. The book includes the claim it was authored by a Special Study Group of fifteen men whose identities were to remain secret and that it was not intended to be made public. It details the analyses of a government panel which concludes that war, or a credible substitute for war, is necessary if governments are to maintain power. The book was a New York Times bestseller and has been translated into fifteen languages. Controversy still swirls over whether the book was a satiric hoax about think-tank logic and writing style or the product of a secret government panel. The document is a favorite among conspiracy theorists, who reject the statement made in 1972 by satirist Leonard Lewin that the book was a spoof and that he was its author. \n\n",
        "Document claims": "When it was first published, controversy surrounded the book over the question whether it was a hoax or real. In an article in the March 19, 1972, edition of The New York Times Book Review, Lewin said that he had written the book.[5]\n\nThe book was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the \"Most Successful Literary Hoax.\" Some people claim that the book is genuine and has only been called a hoax as a means of damage control. Trans-Action devoted an issue to the debate over the book. Esquire magazine published a 28,000-word excerpt.[2]\n\nIn a remembrance of E. L. Doctorow published in 2015 in The Nation, Victor Navasky asserted his involvement in creating Report from Iron Mountain, naming Leonard Lewin as the main writer with \"input\" from economist John Kenneth Galbraith, two editors of the satirical magazine Monocle (Marvin Kitman and Richard Lingeman) and himself. [6]\n\nPurported statements made by John Kenneth Galbraith in support of authenticity\nOn November 26, 1967, the report was reviewed in the book section of The Washington Post by Herschel McLandress, supposedly the pen name for Harvard professor John Kenneth Galbraith. McLandress wrote that he knew firsthand of the report's authenticity because he had been invited to participate in its creation; that although he was unable to be part of the official group, he was consulted from time to time and had been asked to keep the project secret; and that while he doubted the wisdom of letting the public know about the report, he agreed totally with its conclusions.\n\nHe wrote: \"As I would put my personal repute behind the authenticity of this document, so would I testify to the validity of its conclusions. My reservation relates only to the wisdom of releasing it to an obviously unconditioned public.\"[7]\n\nSix weeks later, in an Associated Press dispatch from London, Galbraith went even further and jokingly admitted that he was a member of the conspiracy.[8] The following day, Galbraith backed off. When asked about his 'conspiracy' statement, he replied: \"For the first time since Charles II The Times has been guilty of a misquotation... Nothing shakes my conviction that it was written by either Dean Rusk or Mrs. Clare Boothe Luce\".[9]\n\nThe original reporter reported the following six days later: \"Misquoting seems to be a hazard to which Professor Galbraith is prone. The latest edition of the Cambridge newspaper Varsity quotes the following (tape recorded) interchange: Interviewer: 'Are you aware of the identity of the author of Report from Iron Mountain?' Galbraith: 'I was in general a member of the conspiracy, but I was not the author. I have always assumed that it was the man who wrote the foreword – Mr. Lewin'.\"[10]\n\nIn an article published in New York in 2013, Victor Navasky asserted that Galbraith was indeed McLandress, and that he was \"in on the hoax from the beginning.\"[11]",

        "Document description": "The Chronicle of Rivius is a German-language manuscript often cited by Teodor Narbutt in his nine-volume work on the history of Lithuania and journal articles. Supposedly written between 1697 and 1730s by Jan Fryderyk Rivius, the chronicle remains unpublished. Lithuanian researcher Artūras Dubonis pointed out many inconsistencies in its authorship, unclear provenance, factual and chronological fallacies, and concluded that it is most likely a forgery, though more extensive study is required for a conclusive determination. ",
        "Document claims": "Provenance\nAccording to Narbutt, he accidentally purchased the manuscript in Reval in 1808. He first made references to the chronicle in articles published in 1817. Narbutt did not cite page numbers of the chronicle in his work, though the pages are numbered and he cited the page numbers of the Bychowiec Chronicle. Narbutt prepared a Polish translation of the most important parts of the chronicle and intended to publish it in a collection of primary sources on the history of Lithuania. However, the chronicle remains unpublished and is kept, along with the Narbutt's translation, at the Library of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences.[1]\n\nContent\nThe chronicle is written in German with some phrases in Latin and words in Latvian. Narbutt analyzed the chronicle and claimed that it used an earlier Russian chronicle, compiled by Mitrofan, a monk in Pinsk. This work by Mitrofan was used both by Rivius and by Augustinus Rotundus for his long-lost history. Thus, according to Narbutt, the Chronicle of Rivius preserved some unique fragments of Rotundus' work. Narbutt lamented that fragments of Rotundus work, including two genealogical tables, were lost when the last pages of the manuscript burned during a fire at his library in 1838. However, the surviving manuscript shows no fire damage.[1]\n\nThe chronicle contains many obviously wrong and incorrect facts. For example, it claims that in 1276 a woman gave birth to 346 babies or that Turks made an assault on Belgrade in 1717.[1] The chronicle also contains many unique, otherwise unknown, facts from the history of Lithuania. For example, Lithuanian and Samogitian golden coins from the 13th century, a Lithuanian pagan flag with a cock on the tip of the pole, an inscription on the tombstone of King Mindaugas, a description of the Perkūnas shrine in the Šventaragis' Valley in Vilnius.[1] Some events are described differently in the chronicle than in Narbutt's works. For example, the chronicle records that Duke Mindaugas, his wife, and Andreas von Stirland [ru], Master of the Livonian Order, traveled to Rome in 1254 to discuss Mindaugas' coronation with the pope, while Narbutt described the trip in 1262 when Mindaugas traveled to clear his conscience of the apostasy and desire to serve pagan gods. In his comments to the translation, Narbutt even debated which version is more correct (though both are proved wrong by the 13th-century Livonian Rhymed Chronicle).[2]\n\nAuthor\nNarbutt referred to the chronicle as Kronika niemiecka J. F. R. (German Chronicle of J. F. R.) and revealed its author to be Jan Fryderyk Rivius (1673–1730/1735), grandson of Johann Rivius (1528–1596).[1] However, in his chronicle Rivius provided his grandfather's biography that supplied no new information in addition to what was already known from the encyclopedias of Johann Friedrich von Recke and Karl Eduard von Napiersky, published in 1831, and of Friedrich Konrad Gadebusch [ru], published in 1777. The biography also repeated some mistakes found in these encyclopedias.[1] Also, the 77-year gap between grandfather's death and grandson's birth is virtually impossible. The chronicle makes no mention of Rivius' father or his own life, other than he was born in Königsberg and in 1689 moved to Courland, where he worked as a pastor after pastor Grott moved to Libau. The exact same information about Grott was presented to Narbutt by Napiersky in a letter written in April 1833.[1] Other researchers pointed out a Johannes Fridericus Ruvius from Wenden who became a student at the University of Dorpat in 1690, but Rivius was from Königsberg and it is unlikely that he \"forgot\" to mention his university education. Therefore, researcher Artūras Dubonis concluded that Rivius' biography was invented between 1833 and 1842.[1]",

The work contains multiple plates and maps and is prefaced with the author naming himself \"head of his race\" and \"chief of the prostrated people of this nation\". ",
        "Document claims": "Of the supposed original Phoenician manuscripts, the only evidence O'Connor ever produced for examination was an 18 in (460 mm)-long scroll purporting to be \"a facsimile of part of the great roll of the Laws of Eri\",[3] currently held in the John Rylands Library of the University of Manchester.[4] Scholars who have examined this manuscript \"are unable to find in them the likeness of any known ancient language\".[3] The rest O'Connor claimed were lost or destroyed in various circumstances.[3]\n\nR. A.

        "Document description": "\"Clotilde de Surville\"(c. 1405 – 1498)  was the supposed author of the Poésies de Clotilde.",
        "Document claims": "In 1803 Charles Vanderbourg published as the Poésies de Clotilde some forty poems dealing with love and war. The history given in the introduction of the discovery of the manuscript was evidently a fable, and the poems were set down by most authorities as forgeries, especially as they contained many anachronisms and were written in accordance with modern laws of prosody. The manuscript had been in the possession of Jean François Marie, marquis de Surville, an Émigré who returned to France in 1798 to raise an insurrection in Provence, and had paid the penalty with his life.[5]\n\nIn 1863 Antonin Mace made further inquiries on the subject and discovered letters from Vanderbourg to Surville's widow. This correspondence makes it clear that Vanderbourg was innocent of forgery and believed that the poems were of 15th century date, and that the anachronisms of matter and form were due to retouching by Surville. But the researches of Mace interested local antiquarians, and documentary evidence was produced that the wife of Berenger de Surville was Marguerite Chalis, not Clotilde, and that the marriage dated only from 1428. Moreover, Berenger, whose death at the siege of Orléans was one of the leading motives of the book, lived for twenty years after that date. Friends of M. de Surville also disclosed the fact that the marquis had contributed archaic poetry to a Lausanne journal.[5]",

The well-known Souvenirs de la marquise de Créquy (1710-1803) (a reliable description of the French royal court under Louis XV), printed in 7 volumes, 1834-1835, and purporting to be addressed to her grandson, Tancrède de Créquy, was the production of a Breton adventurer, Cousin de Courchamps. The first two volumes appeared in English in 1834 and were severely criticized in the Quarterly Review.[2]\n\nGod Save the Queen\nIn her Souvenirs, which consists mainly of accurate noble genealogies and court gossip from the reigns of Louis XIV, Louis XV, Louis XVI and Napoleon, there is a tale for which the author of the Souvenirs is the sole authority. This story, widely believed in France,[citation needed] is her statement, with a detailed story to back it up, that Britain's national anthem, \"God Save the Queen\", was in fact written by Lully and sung by a French girls' school to greet Louis XIV.[citation needed] The French author of Souvenirs further states that the tune was later plagiarized by Handel and sold to the British crown as their anthem.[3]\n\nIf it is true, as some have claimed,[citation needed] that the story about the sale of the anthem is actually from a much later tabloid, then this anachronism is a reason why the author of Souvenirs is sometimes placed in the company of forgers, alongside the authors of such works as the Historia Augusta, De Situ Britanniae, and Annio of Viterbo.[citation needed] If, on the other hand, the French tabloids of the 1850s published Madame de Créquy's story based on her memoirs, it's possible she believed the story to be true, or that the story is true.",

However, he maintained that the cornerstone of Aleister's religion of Thelema, The Book of the Law, was a fraud and that The Book of Desolation, a purported text given to him by Aleister, is the only true Crowleyan holy writ.[5] The book has yet to be published and has only been seen by one other person other than Crowley, the writer, musician and filmmaker Jason Brett Serle.[6]\n\nCrowley's biographers have found no documentary evidence regarding Amado's claim of descent from Aleister Crowley, and the claim is universally dismissed as bogus by Crowley scholars.

        "Document description": "The Dark Tower is an incomplete manuscript written by C. S. Lewis that appears to be an unfinished sequel to the science fiction novel Out of the Silent Planet, though allegations have been raised about its authenticity. Perelandra instead became the second book of Lewis' Space Trilogy, concluded by That Hideous Strength. Walter Hooper, Lewis' literary executor, titled the fragment and published it in the 1977 collection The Dark Tower and Other Stories. The Lewis scholar Kathryn Lindskoog challenged the authenticity of the work.",
        "Document claims": "Authenticity and relation to the published novels\nThe Lewis scholar Kathryn Lindskoog advanced the theory that The Dark Tower and other posthumously published works attributed to Lewis were forgeries written by or at the behest of Walter Hooper, based upon her impressions of their style and questions she raised about their provenance. Lindskoog claimed that The Dark Tower resembled stories by other writers, including A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle (1962) and The Planet of the Dead by Clark Ashton Smith (1932).[7][8]\n\nOthers accept that the story is by Lewis, as the author's estate and the publishers assert by publishing it under his name. The oppressive atmosphere of the book is reminiscent of Lewis's own That Hideous Strength (1945) and David Lindsay's A Voyage to Arcturus (1920), which Lewis acknowledged as an influence.\n\nThe Dark Tower does differ to a degree from the published novels of Lewis's The Space Trilogy in setting and subject matter. For example, Ransom becomes a marginal character, and the action takes place partly in an alternate universe. However, if, as Hooper supposes, the text was written prior to Perelandra and That Hideous Strength, it would have had no need to maintain consistency with an as yet unwritten series, especially considering that the tone and subject matter of the published series changes markedly between its first and last books.\n\nMargaret Wheatfield noted that \"In 'The Dark Tower' we see an alternate reality with a dark analogue of Cambridge University, where evil magic is manifest and rampant, and people are made into automatons by the sting of a magical horn. In 'That Hideous Strength' evil magic is at work behind the scenes at an ancient English university in our familiar reality, subtly corrupting the faculty by mundane means - manipulation of academic politics, offers of tempting career advances and of lucrative real estate deals. The terrifying deviltry behind it becomes only gradually visible to the reader. At least to this reviewer, it seems entirely plausible to consider the one as an early draft of the other\".[9]\n\nAlastair Fowler, Regius Professor Emeritus of Rhetoric and English Literature at the University of Edinburgh, to whom Lewis served as a doctoral supervisor, wrote in 2003 that he saw portions of The Dark Tower including the Stinging Man and discussed them with Lewis in 1952.[10]\n\nTwo quantitative stylometric analyses have compared The Dark Tower to other books in the Lewis space trilogy. Both analyses have supported the perception that, for whatever reason, the style of The Dark Tower is atypical of that employed by Lewis in the trilogy. The first concluded from examination of a portion of The Dark Tower's text that \"with respect to the frequency of single letters and particularly letter pairs, The Dark Tower fragment represents a different style than the books comprising Lewis's deep space trilogy.\"[11] The second concluded that \"vocabulary usage in The Dark Tower differs from that predicted by Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra.\"[12]",

        "Document description": "The Description of Britain, also known by its Latin name De Situ Britanniae (\"On the Situation of Britain\"), was a literary forgery perpetrated by Charles Bertram on the historians of England. It purported to be a 15th-century manuscript by the English monk Richard of Westminster, including information from a lost contemporary account of Britain by a Roman general (dux), new details of the Roman roads in Britain in the style of the Antonine Itinerary, and \"an antient map\" as detailed as (but improved upon) the works of Ptolemy. Bertram disclosed the existence of the work through his correspondence with the antiquarian William Stukeley by 1748, provided him \"a copy\" which was made available in London by 1749, and published it in Latin in 1757. By this point, his Richard had become conflated with the historical Richard of Cirencester. The text was treated as a legitimate and major source of information on Roman Britain from the 1750s through the 19th century, when it was progressively debunked by John Hodgson, Karl Wex, B. B. Woodward, and John E. B. Mayor. Effects from the forgery can still be found in works on British history and it is generally credited with having named the Pennine Mountains.",
        "Document claims": "Bertram described his text's author as \"Richard, monk of Westminster\" (Latin: Ricardus monachus Westmonasteriensis). There had been a monk named Richard at Westminster Abbey in the mid-15th century and this was the approximate date offered by Bertram to Stukeley.[8] Stukeley preferred instead to identify Bertram's \"Richard of Westminster\" with Richard of Cirencester (Ricardus de Cirencestria), who had lived at Westminster in the late 14th century and was known to have journeyed to Rome and to have compiled another history known as the Historial Mirror.[9] Bertram fully adopted the suggestion and published his account under the name Ricardus Corinensis,[1] from the archaic Latin form of Cirencester's name.\n\nIt has since become clear that the text was the work of an 18th-century forger. Bertram claimed to have borrowed the text from a friend who admitted he had come by it as an act of theft from an English library. Its complete absence from other manuscript lists and the lack of any trace of it among Bertram's surviving papers in Copenhagen has generally led to the conclusion that Bertram himself was Pseudo-Richard.\n\nAcceptance\nOnce it had been accepted as genuine, The Description of Britain exerted a profound effect upon subsequent theories, suppositions, and publications of history. It was the premier source of information—sometimes the only source—for well over 100 years.\n\nContemporary authoritative works include Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which is well-footnoted with his sources of information. De Situ Britanniae appears among his references to sources on ancient Britain, usually cited to its emended author, Richard of Cirencester. Major-General William Roy's technical ability at surveying was the inspiration for the creation of the Ordnance Survey. He spent much of his research on ancient Scottish history trying to follow the fictional itineraries described in De Situ Britanniae.[16] His historical work, Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain, relies on the forgery and is consequently deficient as a contribution to history, though his maps are still held in the highest regard. William Forbes Skene, in his introduction to Celtic Scotland, written after De Situ Britanniae was debunked, disparaged several once-influential histories that relied on it, including Pinkerton's Enquiry, Chalmers's Caledonia, Roy's Military Antiquities, and Robert Stuart's Caledonia Romana.\n\nNo serious modern historian cites an argument based on the fictional De Situ Britanniae, but conclusions based upon it are still cited indirectly. For example, the influential and respected Barry Cunliffe's Iron Age Communities in Britain places the ancient Selgovae people far to the east of their only known location, contradicting their placement by the sole legitimate source, Ptolemy.[17][18] This misplacement relied on William Roy's attempt to make the map of the peoples of ancient Scotland fit De Situ Britanniae.\n\nDebunking\nEnough doubts had arisen by 1838 that the English Historical Society did not include The Description of Britain in its list of important historical works.[19] Still, the end did not come until 1845. In that year the German writer Friedrich Carl Wex effectively challenged the authority of the Description in the Rheinisches Museum.[20] He had been working on a new edition of Tacitus's Agricola.[21] Consulting the Description, he found that it included impossible transcription errors that had been introduced to editions of Tacitus by Venetian printers in the 15th century.[20] His work was translated into English and printed by the Gentleman's Magazine in October 1846.[22]\n\nBritish scholars were slow to accept the truth.[23] Some of the routes mentioned by the work had seemed to have been subsequently borne out, and excuses were made for the known errors. Further evidence of the falsity of The Description of Britain came out in the following years, however, until no serious effort could be made in defence of the document. Bertram had on several occasions adopted variant readings and hypotheses unknown before Camden.[24] Scholars continued to hem both out of embarrassment (the same information that Wex used had been available to them all along) and because they now knew that their accounts of history had been based on a fiction rather than legitimate information. The final confirmation that the Description was spurious came in 1869, a quarter century after Wex's publication.[25] As part of the Rolls Series, the Historial Mirror written by the real Richard of Cirencester (his only surviving work) was closely examined over the 1860s by J.E.B. Mayor, the librarian of the University of Cambridge. In his 1869 preface to the second volume of the work, he included a thorough 90-page condemnation of Bertram's manuscript.[26] Blame fell hardest on the reputation of William Stukeley, although it also impugned Gibbon, Roy, and other scholars who had accepted it.[25]",

        "Document description": "Nummius Aemilianus Dexter    (fl. 380–395), often erroneously called Flavius Lucius Dexter,    was a figure of the late fourth century, reported as a historian, and a friend of St Jerome. He was the son of St Pacian, an imperial office-holder, and dedicatee of a work of Jerome, the De Viris Illustribus.  He also served as proconsul of Asia under emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395) and hold the position of praetorian prefect of Italy in 395. ",
        "Document claims": "Dexter was the supposed author of a chronicle, called the Omnimoda Historia or the Chronicle of Pseudo-Dexter. It was in fact a forgery, one of a number of Jerónimo Román de la Higuera's (1538–1611), who published a collection of false documents in 1594 attributed to \"Flavius Lucius Dexter\" (alongside \"Marcus Maximus\" and \"Eutrandus\").[7][6] The suspect authorship has been widely known since the work of the Spanish bibliographer Nicolás Antonio, the Censura de historias fabulosas, published in 1742.[6] Doubts were already cast on these false chronicles before 1600, but controversy continued late into the eighteenth century.[8] In the nineteenth century there were still references to the Chronicle as genuine,[9] e.g. its inclusion in Volume 31 of the Patrologia Latina.[10]\n\nThere is a second work attributed to him, In prophetam Danielis de quatuor animalibus (\"Against the prophet Daniel on the four animals\").[11]\n\nThe real Dexter was the author of a genuine work known as the Omnimoda Historia (which St. Jerome refers to in On Illustrious Men 132, but claims he had not read it) but while historians are agreed that it is to be distinguished from the Chronicle of Pseudo-Dexter, the exact nature of the work is debated. Given Jerome's similar phraseology in reference to Eusebius' Chronicle, the work has been seen as either a continuation or translation of that work.[12]",

Although the hoax was exposed in 1839, copies of the Mercurie are still mistakenly referred to as factual accounts in the modern era.",
        "Document claims": "History of the hoax\nHardwicke's literary game\nThe orchestrator of the hoax was Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke, along with his friend Dr Thomas Birch, and possibly Yorke's brother Charles. They produced five issues[2] of which three were printed and two were manuscript newsletters. Dr Birch bequeathed the manuscript and printed copies of the English Mercurie to the British Museum in 1766, without any explanation of their origin.\n\nAcceptance as historical fact\nThe English Mercurie was referred to by George Chalmers, a Scottish antiquarian and political writer, in his 1794 book The Life of Thomas Ruddiman[3] It predated the Mercurius Gallobelgicus which is widely accepted in studies of the history of journalism to be the true first newspaper[citation needed] which was written in Latin and appeared in 1594 in Cologne, Germany, and distributed across Europe. Chalmers adduced the Mercurie as evidence of English invention, saying\n\nIt may gratify our national pride to be told, that mankind are indebted to the wisdom of Elizabeth, and the prudence of Burleigh, for the first newspaper.\n\nThe uncovering of the hoax\nChalmers's assertion was unchallenged for 45 years until Thomas Watts uncovered the existence of the original manuscript in the archives of the British Museum in 1839.[4] He identified the handwriting on the manuscript as being identical to that used in a letter from Yorke as part of Dr Birch's collection.\n\nThere were other inconsistencies, including the typeface and some spellings[2] and Watts also found corrections on the manuscript in Dr Birch's handwriting[4] The motivation of the authors in creating the English Mercurie is unknown, although it has been speculated that it was not an intentional attempt to mislead, but rather a literary game.[4]\n\nModern uses of the English Mercurie\nBritish television network Channel 4 contained a reference to The English Mercurie as \"a newspaper report of Drake's role in the Spanish Armada\" in a website for its series Elizabeth's Pirates.[5]\n\nThe National Library of Australia includes The English Mercurie in its catalogue, among other apparently genuine historical documents from the Tudor and Stuart periods.[6]",

        "Document description": "Fei hua qing han (simplified Chinese: 飞花轻寒; traditional Chinese: 飛花輕寒) is an apocryphal poem falsely attributed to Li Bai, an influential 8th-century Chinese poet. The poem attracted attention in the Chinese Internet community when some people deciphered a hidden message in it that says \"Go to hell Japan, Koizumi must die\" (日本去死, 小泉定亡).   It was later revealed that the poem was written around 2003 to 2004.",
        "Document claims": "Following along with the Japanese history textbook controversies and a decline in Sino-Japanese relations, the poem began to circulate over China internet community via forwarded email and internet forums around 2003 to 2004. The circulation peaked during the 2005 anti-Japanese demonstrations.\n\nIt was quickly revealed that not only does the cadence of the poem fail to match the tradition of Tang poetry, its writing style also differs from that of Li Bai. The archive of Li Bai also does not contain any such poem.[3]\n\nThe real author is yet to be revealed, but it is believed to be written by a mainland Chinese angered by Japan's denial of World War II war crimes.\n\n\nJunichiro Koizumi's frequent visits to Yasukuni Shrine made him a target for Chinese nationalists.\nReaction to the poem has been mixed. Although its authenticity has been doubted from the beginning, some claimed that it was an \"insight\" of Li Bai who would foresee the war crime of Japan. Some Chinese[weasel words] felt disgraced by the humor, and blamed the author was so childish and shameful to imitate Li Bai in a bad taste apocryphal poem. However, most people[weasel words] simply took it as a joke.[citation needed]\n\nTaking the first and last characters of each line as a single sentence, it reads \"Go to hell Japan, Koizumi must die\" (日本去死, 小泉定亡).\n\nIn Chinese literature, there is a long tradition of hiding sensitive messages, mostly political related ones, in the lines of a poem. These hidden messages can be seen by reading the poem horizontally, diagonally, clockwise or anti-clockwise. One famous example is a poem protesting against Chinese prime minister Li Peng, after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. The poem seemingly showed strong support for the communist-governed China, and was published by the People's Daily in 1991, but when read diagonally, it showed a slogan \"Li Peng must resign to appease anger of the people\", which embarrassed the Chinese government.",

        "Document description": "The Franklin Prophecy, sometimes called the Franklin Forgery, is an antisemitic speech falsely attributed to Benjamin Franklin, warning of the supposed dangers of admitting Jews to the nascent United States. The speech was purportedly transcribed by Charles Cotesworth Pinckney during the Constitutional Convention of 1787, but was unknown before its appearance in 1934 in the pages of William Dudley Pelley's Silver Legion pro-Nazi magazine Liberation. No evidence exists for the document's authenticity, and some of Pelley's claims have actively been disproven. ",
        "Document claims": "Authenticity\nAccording to Pelley, Pinckney wrote that he had kept a journal of the convention. This journal has never been found, and no evidence exists for Pelley's claim that it was printed privately. The Franklin Institute has rejected Pelley's claims that it owns a manuscript copy of the speech.[3]\n\nThe U.S. Congress report Anti-Semitism in Europe: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations (2004) states:\n\nThe Franklin \"Prophecy\" is a classic anti-Semitic canard that falsely claims that American statesman Benjamin Franklin made anti-Jewish statements during the Constitutional Convention of 1787. It has found widening acceptance in Muslim and Arab media, where it has been used to criticize Israel and Jews...[4]\n\nFranklin was a friend to the Jews of 18th-century America,[2] and contributed toward the building of Philadelphia's first permanent synagogue.[5] The Anti-Defamation League noted that the reference to the civilized world giving Palestine back to the Jews was an anachronism, since the modern Zionist movement did not arise until nearly a century after Franklin's death.[2]\n\nSimilar antisemitic quotations have been attributed to George Washington and have been disproven.[6] In 1790, in a marked sign of religious tolerance, Washington sent a letter to the Jewish community in Rhode Island, writing \"May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while every one shall sit under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.\"[7]\n\nUsage\nDespite having been repeatedly discredited since its first appearance, the \"Prophecy\" has proved a remarkably durable antisemitic canard.[1] It has appeared most recently as a popular Internet hoax promulgated on Usenet groups and antisemitic websites, where it is presented as authentic. On February 18, 1998, a member of the Fatah Central Committee revived this myth, while mistakenly referring to Franklin as a former President of the United States.[8] Osama bin Laden used this canard briefly in his October 2002 \"Letter to the American People.\"[9]",

It is now regarded as a forgery.\n\nThe dramatic and blood curdling accounts of Histoire were incorporated as a primary source into many other volumes, notably Joseph Hansen's (1862–1943) German Quellen und Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des Hexenwahns und der Hexenverfolgung im Mittelalter (\"Sources and investigations regarding the history of the witch craze and the witch hunts in the Middle Ages\"), which in turn became the source for many other works. Ultimately, Lamothe-Langon's work became the sole or principal primary source for a substantial part of twentieth century popular and historical beliefs about the Inquisition, witchcraft, torture and jurisprudence in the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the historians Norman Cohn and Richard Kieckhefer independently discovered that the Histoire was a fabrication; Lamothe-Langon's archive did not exist, he did not have the paleographic skills to read books of that age anyway, several major events he described could not have occurred, and his book was full of anachronisms.\n\nPrior to fabricating the Histoire, Lamothe-Langon had been an author of gothic horror novels.

        "Document description": "The Historia Augusta (English: Augustan History) is a late Roman collection of biographies, written in Latin, of the Roman emperors, their junior colleagues, designated heirs and usurpers from 117 to 284. Supposedly modeled on the similar work of Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, it presents itself as a compilation of works by six different authors (collectively known as the Scriptores Historiae Augustae), written during the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine I and addressed to those emperors or other important personages in Ancient Rome. The collection, as extant, comprises thirty biographies, most of which contain the life of a single emperor, but some include a group of two or more, grouped together merely because these emperors were either similar or contemporaneous. The true authorship of the work, its actual date, its reliability and its purpose have long been matters for controversy by historians and scholars ever since Hermann Dessau, in 1889, rejected both the date and the authorship as stated within the manuscript. Major problems include the nature of the sources that it used, and how much of the content is pure fiction. For instance, the collection contains in all about 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations.By the second decade of the 21st century, the consensus supported the position that there was only a single author, who wrote either in the late 4th century or the early 5th century, who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. There is further consensus that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus, in a complex allegorical game.  Despite the conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and so is continually being re-evaluated. Modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels. ",
        "Document claims": "Debates on dating\nIn 1776, Gibbon observed that there was something wrong with the numbers and names of the imperial biographers, and that this had already been recognised by older historians who had written on that subject.[note 1][18][19] A clear example was the referencing of the biographer 'Lampridius' (who was apparently writing his biographies after 324) by 'Vopiscus', who was meant to be writing his biographies in 305–306.[20] Then, in 1889, Hermann Dessau, who had become increasingly concerned by the large number of anachronistic terms, Vulgar Latin vocabulary, and especially the host of obviously false proper names in the work, proposed that the six authors were all fictitious personae, and that the work was in fact composed by a single author in the late 4th century, probably in the reign of Theodosius I.[21][22] Among his supporting evidence was that the life of Septimius Severus appeared to have made use of a passage from the mid-4th-century historian Aurelius Victor,[note 2] and that the life of Marcus Aurelius likewise uses material from Eutropius.[note 3][23]\n\nIn the decades following Dessau, many scholars argued to preserve at least some of the six Scriptores as distinct persons and in favour of the first-hand authenticity for the content. As early as 1890, Theodor Mommsen postulated a Theodosian 'editor' of the Scriptores' work, an idea that has resurfaced many times since.[24] Hermann Peter, editor of the Historia Augusta and of the Historicorum Romanorum reliquiae, proposed a date of 330 for when the work was written, based upon an analysis of style and language.[25] Others, such as Norman H. Baynes, abandoned the early 4th-century date but only advanced it as far as the reign of Julian the Apostate, useful for arguing the work was intended as pagan propaganda.[26]\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Dessau's original arguments received powerful restatement and expansion from Sir Ronald Syme, who devoted three books to the subject and was prepared to date the writing of the work closely in the region of AD 395. Other recent studies also show much consistency of style,[27] and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395.[28] Although it was believed that the Historia Augusta did not reference any material from Ammianus Marcellinus' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period,[29] this has now been shown not to be the case, and that the Historia Augusta does in fact make reference to Ammianus' history.[30]\n\nNot all scholars have accepted the theory of a forger working around the last decades of the 4th century or the beginning of the 5th. Arnaldo Momigliano[31][32][33] and A. H. M. Jones[34] were the most prominent 20th century critics of the Dessau-Syme theory amongst English-speaking scholars. Momigliano, summarizing the literature from Dessau down to 1954, defined the question as \"res iudicanda\" (i.e. \"a matter to be decided\") and not as \"res iudicata\" (\"a matter that has been decided\"). Momigliano reviewed every book published on the topic by Sir Ronald Syme, and provided counter arguments to most if not all of Syme's arguments.[32][33]\n\nFor instance, the reference in the Life of Probus about the emperor's descendants which has been taken to refer to Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) and his family may, in the opinion of Momigliano, equally refer to the earlier members of the family, which was prominent throughout the 4th century, such as Petronius Probinus (consul in 341) and Petronius Probianus (consul in 322).[35] Momigliano's opinion was that there was insufficient evidence to dismiss a composition date of the early 4th century, and that any post-Constantinian anachronisms could be explained by an editor working on the material at a later date, perhaps during the reigns of Constantius II or Julian.[36]\n\nOther opinions included H Stern's, who postulated that the History was composed by a team of writers during the reign of Constantius II after the defeat of Magnentius on behalf of the senatorial aristocracy who had supported the usurper.[37] In the 21st century, Alan Cameron rebutted a number of Syme's and Barnes' arguments for a composition date c. 395–400, suggesting a composition date between 361 and the 380s.[38]\n\nAuthorship debate\nLinked to the problem of dating the composition of the History is the question about the authorship of the work. Taking the History at face value, there is clearly a division between the authors named prior and after the presence of the interrupting lacuna. For the first half of the History, four scriptores are present, and the biographies are divided in a remarkably erratic fashion:[39]\n\nAelius Spartianus (7 lives): Hadrian, Aelius, Didius Julianus, Severus, Niger, Caracalla and Geta.\nJulius Capitolinus (9 lives): Antoninus, Marcus, Lucius Verus, Pertinax, Albinus, Macrinus, The Maximini, The Gordiani, and Maximus and Balbinus.\nVulcacius Gallicanus (1 life): Avidius Cassius.\nAelius Lampridius (4 lives): Commodus, Diadumenus, Heliogabalus and Severus Alexander.\nOf these four, Spartianus and Gallicanus claim to be undertaking a complete set of imperial biographies from Julius Caesar onwards, while Lampridius' stated intention was to write a collection of biographies that would deal with the Gordians, Claudius II, Aurelian, Diocletian, Maximian and the four rivals of Constantine. Capitolinus also implied that he was writing more biographies than are present in the History.[40]\n\nThe second half of the History is divided between two scriptores. Unlike the first half, the emperors tackled in this section are grouped logically, and are divided roughly in half between the two scriptores in chronological sequence:\n\nTrebellius Pollio (4 lives): Valerian, Gallienus, Tyranni Triginta and Claudius.\nFlavius Vopiscus Syracusanus (5 lives): Aurelian, Tacitus, Probus, Quadrigae Tyrannorum and Carus, Carinus and Numerian.\nIn terms of any acknowledgement of the mutual existence between the scriptores, only Flavius Vopiscus, ostensibly writing in 305 or 306,[note 4][41] refers to any of the other authors, specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius. None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of any of their 'colleagues'.[41] However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the Albinus, Maximini and Gordiani he addresses Constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306.[20]\n\nThe theory that there was a single author, as initially postulated by Hermann Dessau, is based on the difficulties inherent in having a single work comprising a number of individuals but without any textual evidence of an editor who brought the material together. This is especially evident in that the text has examples of stated intentions by an author to write a life of one of the emperors, only for that life to be completed by another of the scriptores.[note 5][42] If those statements are true, and those additional lives were completed, then an editor must have been involved in the project in order to select one scriptor's life over another's.[42]\n\nThe presence of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by Theodor Mommsen, still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of the second half of the History, operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series.[43] He takes the view that the vast stylistic differences between the two halves of the History means they cannot have been written by the same author.[43]\n\nIf the validity of six independent authors is accepted, there are still issues, as the way they approached their work shows similar themes and details.[42] All six not only provide biographies for the emperors, but also for the Caesars and usurpers. They describe their work and approach in very similar language, and quote otherwise unknown historians and biographers, such as Junius Cordus. They collectively share many errors, such as calling Diadumenianus \"Diadumenus\".[42] They share much idiosyncratic content and similar language, with particular focus on women, wine and military discipline, and were fixated on poor-quality plays on words ascribing personality traits to certain emperors, for instance Verus was truthful, while Severus was a severe individual.[42]\n\nThe authors shared certain stylistic characteristics that has been suggested would not naturally occur between individuals writing separately. For instance, the authors all happen to use the word occido with respect to killing, a total of 42 occurrences, but only once do any of them use the alternative word of interficio. This ratio is not found with any other writers in this time period and for this genre.[42] Each of the six scriptores authored fictional lives for some of their biographies, all of them using fake sources, documents and acclamations.[44]\n\nIt has been postulated that the names of the scriptores themselves are a form of literary playfulness, not only mocking both legitimate authors and historians, but the narrative itself.[45] The names Trebellius Pollio and Flavius Vopiscus are sourced in various ways from Cicero's writings,[46] as is the name Capitolinus.[47] The word vopiscus is a rare Latin term, referring to a twin who survives, while its sibling died in utero. This has been interpreted to refer to \"Flavius Vopiscus\" as being the final one to survive from the six authors of the History.[47] Vulcacius is believed to be a mockery of Volcatius Sedigitus, who was a historical literary critic with some association with humor. The meanings behind the other two scriptores, Spartianus and Lampridius, have eluded interpretation.[48]\n\nIt should also be noted that the results of recent computer-assisted stylistic analysis concerning the single vs multiple authorship have proven to be inconclusive:\n\n\"Computer-aided stylistic analysis of the work has, however, returned ambiguous results; some elements of style are quite uniform throughout the work, while others vary in a way that suggests multiple authorship. To what extent this is due to the fact that portions of the work are obviously compiled from multiple sources is unclear. Several computer analyses of the text have been done to determine whether there were multiple authors. Many of them conclude that there was but a single author, but disagree on methodology. However, several studies done by the same team concluded there were several authors, though they were not sure how many.\"[49]\n\nPrimary and secondary Vitae\nA unique feature of the Historia Augusta is that it purports to supply the biographies not only of reigning Emperors, called \"primary lives\" by modern scholars, but also \"secondary lives\" of their designated heirs, junior colleagues, and usurpers who unsuccessfully claimed the supreme power.[50] Thus among the biographies of 2nd-century and early 3rd-century figures are included Hadrian's heir Aelius Caesar, and the usurpers Avidius Cassius, Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus, Caracalla's brother Geta and Macrinus' son Diadumenianus. None of these pieces contain much in the way of solid information: all are marked by rhetorical padding and obvious fiction. The biography of Marcus Aurelius' colleague Lucius Verus, which Mommsen thought 'secondary', is rich in apparently reliable information and has been vindicated by Syme as belonging to the 'primary' series.[51]\n\nThe 'secondary' lives allowed the author to exercise freedom in the invention of events, places and people without the need to conform to authentic historical facts.[52] As the work proceeds the author's inventiveness undergoes an increasing degree of elaboration as legitimate historical sources begin to run out, eventually composing largely fictional accounts such as the \"biographies\" of the \"Thirty Tyrants\", whom the author claimed had risen as usurpers under Gallienus. After the biography of Caracalla the 'primary' biographies, of the emperors themselves, begin to assume the rhetorical and fictive qualities previously confined to the 'secondary' ones, probably because the secondary lives were written after the Life of Caracalla.[53]\n\nThe biography of Macrinus is notoriously unreliable,[54] and after a partial reversion to reliability in the Life of Elagabalus, the Alexander Severus, one of the longest biographies in the entire work, develops into a kind of exemplary and rhetorical fable on the theme of the wise philosopher king.[55] Clearly the author's previous sources had given out, but also his inventive talents were developing. He still makes use of some recognized sources – Herodian up to 238, and probably Dexippus in the later books, for the entire imperial period the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte as well as Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, Ammianus Marcellinus and Jerome – but the biographies are increasingly tracts of invention in which occasional nuggets of fact are embedded.[56][30]\n\nEven where recognisable facts are present, their use in the History cannot be taken at face value. In the Life of Alexander Severus, the History makes the claim at 24.4 that Alexander had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal, although the author added that the emperor Philip later banned the practice.[57] Although the claim about Alexander is false, the note about Philip is true – the source of this is Aurelius Victor (28.6–7, and who sourced it from the Kaisergeschichte), and the History even copies Victor's style of moralising asides, which were not in the Kaisergeschichte.[58] Normally, this anecdote would have been included in a Life of Philip, but its absence saw the author include it in another life. This is taken as evidence that the mid-work lacuna is deliberate, as the author was apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from the Kaisergeschichte.[57]\n\nHistorical value\nFrom the sixth century to the end of the 19th century, historians had recognized that the Historia Augusta was a flawed and not a particularly reliable source, and since the 20th century modern scholars have tended to treat it with extreme caution.[12][74] Older historians, such as Edward Gibbon, not fully aware of its problems with respect to the fictitious elements contained within it, generally treated the information preserved within it as authentic. For instance, in Gibbon's account of the reign of Gallienus, he uncritically reproduces the Historia Augusta's biased and largely fictional account of that reign.[75] So when Gibbon states \"The repeated intelligence of invasions, defeats, and rebellions, he received with a careless smile; and singling out, with affected contempt, some particular production of the lost province, he carelessly asked, whether Rome must be ruined, unless it was supplied with linen from Egypt, and arras cloth from Gaul\",[76] he is reworking the passage in The Two Gallieni:\n\nI am ashamed to relate what Gallienus used often to say at this time, when such things were happening, as though jesting amid the ills of mankind. For when he was told of the revolt of Egypt, he is said to have exclaimed \"What! We cannot do without Egyptian linen!\" and when informed that Asia had been devastated both by the violence of nature and by the inroads of the Scythians, he said, \"What! We cannot do without saltpetre!\" and when Gaul was lost, he is reported to have laughed and remarked, \"Can the commonwealth be safe without Atrebatic cloaks?\" Thus, in short, with regard to all parts of the world, as he lost them, he would jest, as though seeming to have suffered the loss of some article of trifling service.[77]\n\nGibbon then noted after this passage: \"This singular character has, I believe, been fairly transmitted to us. The reign of his immediate successor was short and busy; and the historians who wrote before the elevation of the family of Constantine could not have the most remote interest to misrepresent the character of Gallienus.\"[78] Modern scholars now believe that Gallienus' reputation was posthumously maligned, that he was one of the main architects of the later Roman imperial structure, and that his reforms were built upon by succeeding emperors.[79]\n\nNevertheless, it is unwise to dismiss it altogether as it is also the principal Latin source regarding a century of Roman history. For example, scholars had assumed that Veturius Macrinus, mentioned in the Life of Didius Julianus, was an invention of the author, like so many other names. However, an inscription was uncovered which confirmed his existence and his post as praetorian prefect in 193.[80] Likewise, the information that Hadrian's Wall was constructed during Hadrian's reign[81] and that the Antonine Wall was built during the reign of Antoninus Pius[82] are recorded by no other extant ancient writer apart from the Historia Augusta,[note 6] the veracity of which has been confirmed by inscriptions.[84]\n\nFalse documents and authorities\nA peculiarity of the work is its inclusion of a large number of purportedly authentic documents such as extracts from Senate proceedings and letters written by imperial personages.[85][86] In all it contains around 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations.[87] Records like these are quite distinct from the rhetorical speeches often inserted by ancient historians – it was accepted practice for the writer to invent these himself[88] – and on the few occasions when historians, such as Sallust in his work on Catiline or Suetonius in his Twelve Caesars, include such documents, they have generally been regarded as genuine.[89] Almost all those found in the Historia Augusta have been rejected as fabrications, partly on stylistic grounds, partly because they refer to military titles or points of administrative organisation which are otherwise unrecorded until long after the purported date, or for other suspicious content.[90][91][92]\n\nThe History cites dozens of otherwise unrecorded historians, biographers, letter-writers, knowledgeable friends of the writers, and so on, most of whom must be regarded as expressions of the author's creative imagination.[93] For example, the biographer \"Cordus\" is cited twenty-seven times in the History. Long considered to be a real, but lost, biographer until midway into the 20th century,[94][95] with a couple of minor exceptions where material claimed to be sourced from Cordus is in reality from Suetonius or Cicero, every other citation is fake, providing details which have been invented and ascribed to Cordus. Cordus is mentioned almost exclusively in those Vitae where the History used Herodian as the primary source, and his appearances vanish once Herodian's history comes to an end.[96]\n\nThe author also misattributes material taken from a legitimate historian and ascribe it to a fictitious author. For instance, Herodian is used more often than he is explicitly referenced in the History. In addition to the ten times he is correctly cited, three times his material is cited as \"Arrianus\", probably to multiply the author's sources.[23] Not only does the author copy from Herodian without citation, either direct lifts, abbreviations or supplementations, he often distorts Herodian, to suit his literary objective.[23][97]\n\nThen there is the deliberate citation of false information which is then ascribed legitimate authors. For instance, at a minimum, five of the History's sixteen citations of Dexippus are considered to be fake, and Dexippus appears to be mentioned, not as a principal source of information, but rather as a contradictory author to be contrasted against information sourced from Herodian or the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte. In addition Quintus Gargilius Martialis, who produced works on horticulture and medicine, is cited twice as a biographer, which is considered to be another false attribution.[98]\n\nExamples of false historical events and personages\nThe untrustworthiness of the History stems from the multifarious kinds of fraudulent, as opposed to simply inaccurate, information that run through the work, becoming ever more dominant as it proceeds.[52] The various biographies are ascribed to different invented 'authors', and continue with the dedicatory epistles to Diocletian and Constantine, the quotation of fabricated documents, the citation of non-historical authorities, the invention of persons, extending even to the subjects of some of the minor biographies, presentation of contradictory information to confuse an issue while making a show of objectivity, deliberately false statements, and the inclusion of material which can be shown to relate to events or personages of the late 4th century rather than the period supposedly being written about.[99] For example:\n\nThe biography of Geta states he was born in Mediolanum on 27 May. The year is not specified but it was 'in the suffect consulships of Severus and Vitellius'.[100] He was actually born in Rome on 7 March 189. There was no such pair of suffect consuls in this or any other year.[101] It has been suggested that the names for these persons be amended to be Severus and Vettulenus, and that these men were suffect consuls sometime before 192.[102]\nIn the Vita Commodi, the biography on emperor Commodus, there is much doubt about the authenticity of the sources used and cited. Lampridius, the pseudonym the author works with here, claims to have used Marius Maximus on multiple occasions for his work.[103] One instance forms a case in point: Lampridius supposedly quotes the senatorial speeches in Maximus’ work which were held after Commodus’ death.[104] It is unclear whether the references to Maximus are genuine or made up by the author to give himself a sense of authority and expertise.[105] Baldwin thinks that the senatorial speeches are probably a figment of Lampridius’ imagination.[106] Molinier-Arbo believes in their authenticity. She suggests that the full report of the acta senatus (lit. acts of the senate) was handed down in the acta urbis (a kind of city gazette). Marius Maximus could have used this report for his work and Lampridius could have used it later on.[107]\nA letter of Hadrian written from Egypt to his brother-in-law Servianus is quoted at length, and was accepted as genuine by many authorities well into the 20th century.[108] Servianus is saluted as consul, and Hadrian mentions his adopted son Lucius Aelius Caesar: but Hadrian was in Egypt in 130, Servianus' consulship fell in 134, and Hadrian adopted Aelius in 136.[109][110] The letter is said to have been published by Hadrian's freedman Phlegon, with the letter's existence not mentioned anywhere except in the History, in another suspect passage.[111] A passage in the letter dealing with the frivolousness of Egyptian religious beliefs refers to the Patriarch, head of the Jewish community in the Empire. This office only came into being after Hadrian put down the Jewish revolt of 132, and the passage is probably meant in mockery of the powerful late 4th-century Patriarch, Gamaliel.[112]\nDecius revives the office of Censor; the Senate acclaims Valerian as worthy to hold it in a decree dated 27 October 251. The decree is brought to Decius, on campaign against the Goths, and he summons Valerian to bestow the honour.[113] The revival of the censorship is fictitious, and Decius had been dead for several months by the date stated.[114]\nValerian holds an imperial council in Byzantium, attended by several named dignitaries, none of them otherwise attested and some holding offices not known to exist until the following century, at which the general 'Ulpius Crinitus', a name apparently chosen to evoke the military glories of the Emperor Trajan, takes the young Aurelian, destined to be another military Emperor, as his adopted son. There are no grounds to believe this is anything other than invention.[115]\n\nTrebellianus, one of the fictitious tyrants included in the Historia Augusta, drawn by Guillaume Rouillé in Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum- 1553\nIn the Tyranni Triginta, the author 'Trebellius Pollio' sets out to chronicle 'the 30 usurpers who arose in the years when the Empire was ruled by Gallienus and Valerian'.[116] The number 30 is evidently modelled on the notorious 'Thirty Tyrants' who ruled Athens after the end of the Peloponnesian War.[117] The chapter contains 32 mini-biographies. They include two women, six youths, and seven men who never claimed the imperial power, one usurper of the reign of Maximinus Thrax, one of the time of Decius, and two of the time of Aurelian, and a number who are not historical personages: Postumus the Younger, Saturninus, Trebellianus, Celsus, Titus, Censorinus, and Victorinus Junior.[118]\nIn the Life of Tacitus, the emperor is acclaimed by the Senate, meeting in the Curia Pompiliana, which never existed.[119] The History then lists a number of individuals, all of whom are invented by the author: the consul 'Velius Cornificius Gordianus',[120] 'Maecius Faltonius Nicomachus',[121] the Prefect of the City 'Aelius Cesettianus',[122] and the Praetorian Prefect 'Moesius Gallicanus'.[123] Private letters commending Tacitus are quoted from the senators 'Autronius Tiberianus' and 'Claudius Sapilianus', both of whom are assumed to be non-historical personages.[124] Most of the 'Maecii' and 'Gallicani' in the History are believed to be inventions of the author.[121][123]\nIn the Quadrigae Tyrannorum (Four tyrants: The Lives of Firmus, Saturninus, Proculus and Bonosus[125]), the author includes Firmus, said to have been a usurper in Egypt under Aurelian.[126][127] There is no certainty that this person ever existed. There was a Corrector named Claudius Firmus stationed in Egypt in 274, about the time Zosimus states that Aurelian was dealing with some trouble in that province.[128] Nevertheless, the History's wealth of detail about him is considered to be completely invented.[129] For example, he would eat an ostrich a day, he had a carriage drawn by ostriches, he would swim among crocodiles, he built himself a house fitted with square panels of glass.[130]\nIn the Life of Probus,[131] the author 'Flavius Vopiscus of Syracuse' states that the Emperor's descendants (posteri) fled from Rome and settled near Verona. There a statue of Probus was struck by lightning, a portent according to soothsayers 'that future generations of the family would rise to such distinction in the senate they all would hold the highest posts', though Vopiscus, supposedly writing under Constantine, says this prophecy has not yet come to pass. This is one of the strongest indications of the History's late 4th-century date, as it seems to be a fairly transparent allusion to the rich and powerful senator Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) whose two sons held the consulship together in 395.[132][133] Petronius Probus was born in Verona.[134]\nMarius Maximus or 'Ignotus'?\nCertain scholars have always defended the value of specific parts of the work. Anthony Birley, for instance, has argued that the lives up to Septimius Severus are based on the now-lost biographies of Marius Maximus, which were written as a sequel to Suetonius' Lives of the Twelve Caesars.[135] As a result, his translation of the History for Penguin Books covers only the first half, and was published as Lives of the Later Caesars, Birley himself supplying biographies of Nerva and Trajan (these are not part of the original texts, which begin with Hadrian).\n\nHis view (part of a tradition that goes back to J. J. Müller, who advanced Marius' claims as early as 1870, and supported by modern scholars such as André Chastagnol) was vigorously contested by Ronald Syme, who theorized that virtually all the identifiable citations from Marius Maximus are essentially frivolous interpolations into the main narrative source, which he postulated was a different Latin author whom he styled 'Ignotus (\"the unknown one\"), the good biographer'.[136][137]\n\nHis theory argued, firstly, that as Marius wrote a sequel to the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, his work covered the reigns from Nerva to Elagabalus; consequently, this would not have included a biography of Lucius Verus, even though the biography of that Princeps in the History is mainly of good quality.[138] Secondly, that 'Ignotus' only went up to Caracalla, as is revealed by the inferior and mostly fictitious biography of Macrinus.[139]\n\nFinally, that the composer of the Historia Augusta wrote the lives of the emperors through to the Life of Caracalla, including Lucius Verus, using Ignotus as his main source, and supplementing with Marius Maximus on occasion.[140] It was only when the source failed that he turned to other less reliable sources (such as Herodian and Maximus),[141] as well as his own fertile imagination, and it was at this juncture that he composed the first five minor lives, through to the Life of Geta.[142]\n\nA similar theory to Syme's has been put forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was probably a satirical poet, in the same vein as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all.[143] His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations.[98] This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley[143] and David Rohrbacher.[144]\n\nLiterary value\nThe Historia Augusta has been described by Ronald Syme as \"the most enigmatic work that Antiquity has transmitted\".[74] Although much of the focus of study throughout the centuries has been on the historical content, since the 20th century there has also been an assessment of the literary value of the work. For much of that time the assessment has been critical, as demonstrated by the analysis put forward by David Magie:\n\nThe literary, as well as the historical, value of the Historia Augusta has suffered greatly as a result of the method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.[145]\n\nM. L. W. Laistner was of the opinion that \"even if the Historia Augusta was propaganda disguised as biography, it is still a wretched piece of literature\",[146] while Ronald Syme noted that with respect to the author's Latin prose:\n\nHe was not an elegant exponent. His normal language is flat and monotonous. But uneven, and significantly so. For this author is erudite, a fancier of words, and a collector. Hence many rarities, or even inventions ... first, when depicting the measures of a military disciplinarian, he brings in technical terms redolent of the camp. Second, archaism, preciosity, and flowery words.[147]\n\nFurther, the work shows evidence of its having been put together in a very haphazard and hasty fashion, with little to no subsequent editing of the material to form a cohesive narrative.[148] Birley sees an example of the carelessness with which the author approached the work in the construction of Marcus Aurelius' biography, where midway through the Life of Marcus Aurelius the author found himself in a muddle, probably because he had historical material in excess of what he required, and because he had already used up much of his source to write separate biographies of Lucius Verus and Avidius Cassius, whose lives intersected with Marcus'.[149]\n\nThe answer he came up with was to use Eutropius as his source for a brief overview of Marcus' principate following the death of Lucius Verus.[149] However, he found that in doing so, the narrative's ending was too abrupt and so, after including some gossip about Commodus not being his son, he once again began an account of Marcus' reign after the death of Verus.[149]\n\nAlthough these criticisms still form the prevailing view on the History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work,[150][151] its use of allusion as a vehicle for parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, making it one of the most unusual pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.[152][71]",

Momigliano, summarizing the literature from Dessau down to 1954, defined the question as \"res iudicanda\" (i.e. \"a matter to be decided\") and not as \"res iudicata\" (\"a matter that has been decided\"). Momigliano reviewed every book published on the topic by Sir Ronald Syme, and provided counter arguments to most if not all of Syme's arguments.[32][33]\n\nFor instance, the reference in the Life of Probus about the emperor's descendants which has been taken to refer to Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) and his family may, in the opinion of Momigliano, equally refer to the earlier members of the family, which was prominent throughout the 4th century, such as Petronius Probinus (consul in 341) and Petronius Probianus (consul in 322).[35] Momigliano's opinion was that there was insufficient evidence to dismiss a composition date of the early 4th century, and that any post-Constantinian anachronisms could be explained by an editor working on the material at a later date, perhaps during the reigns of Constantius II or Julian.[36]",

The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.",

        "Document description": "The Hitler Diaries (German: Hitler-Tagebücher) were a series of sixty volumes of journals purportedly written by Adolf Hitler, but forged by Konrad Kujau between 1981 and 1983. The diaries were purchased in 1983 for 9.3 million Deutsche Marks (£2.3 million or $3.7 million) by the West German news magazine Stern, which sold serialisation rights to several news organisations. One of the publications involved was The Sunday Times, who asked their independent director, the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, to authenticate the diaries; he did so, pronouncing them genuine. At the press conference to announce the publication, Trevor-Roper announced that on reflection he had changed his mind, and other historians also raised questions concerning their validity. Rigorous forensic analysis, which had not been performed previously, quickly confirmed that the diaries were fakes.Kujau, born and raised in East Germany, had a history of petty crime and deception. In the mid-1970s he began selling Nazi memorabilia which he had smuggled from the East, but found he could raise the prices by forging additional authentication details to associate ordinary souvenirs to the Nazi leaders. He began forging paintings by Hitler and an increasing number of notes, poems and letters, until he produced his first diary in the mid-to-late 1970s. The West German journalist with Stern who \"discovered\" the diaries and was involved in their purchase was Gerd Heidemann, who had an obsession with the Nazis. When Stern started buying the diaries, Heidemann stole a significant proportion of the money.Kujau and Heidemann spent time in prison for their parts in the fraud, and several newspaper editors lost their jobs. The story of the scandal was the basis for the films Selling Hitler (1991) for the British channel ITV, the German film Schtonk! (1992), and the television series Faking Hitler (2021).",
        "Document claims": "Initial testing and verification; steps towards publication\nIn April 1982 Walde and Heidemann contacted Josef Henke and Klaus Oldenhage of the Bundesarchiv (German Federal Archives) and Max Frei-Sulzer, the former head of the forensic department of the Zürich police, for assistance in authenticating the diaries. They did not specifically mention the diaries, but referred generally to new material. They also did not give the forensic specialists an entire diary, but removed one page only. For comparison purposes they also provided the experts with other samples of Hitler's writing, a handwritten draft for a telegram: this was from Heidemann's own collection and had also been forged by Kujau. Within days Walde provided further documents for comparison—all Kujau forgeries.[88] Walde then flew to the US and commissioned Ordway Hilton, another forensic expert.[p] None of those involved were experts in examining Nazi documents, and Hilton could not read German. Stern's management were too bound up in a secretive approach to be open about their source, or to provide the experts with a complete diary, which would have led to a more thorough examination of wider material.[90] From the samples provided, the experts concluded that the handwriting was genuine. Hilton subsequently reported that \"there was just no question\" that both documents he had were written by the same person, whom he assumed to be Hitler.[91]\n\nThe purchase of the diaries continued, and by June 1982 Gruner + Jahr possessed 35 volumes.[92] In early 1983 the company took the decision to work towards a publication date for the diaries. To ensure wide readership and to maximise their returns, Stern issued a prospectus to potentially interested parties, Newsweek, Time, Paris Match and a syndicate of papers owned by Murdoch.[93] Stern rented a large vault in a Swiss bank. They filled the space with Nazi memorabilia and displayed various letters and manuscripts.[94]\n\nThe first historian to examine the diaries was Hugh Trevor-Roper, who was cautious, but impressed with the volume of documentation in front of him.[95] As the background to the acquisition was explained to him he became less doubtful; he was falsely informed that the paper had been chemically tested and been shown to be pre-war, and he was told that Stern knew the identity of the Wehrmacht officer who had rescued the documents from the plane and had stored them ever since.[96] By the end of the meeting he was convinced that the diaries were genuine, and later said \"who, I asked myself, would forge sixty volumes when six would have served his purpose?\"[97] In an article in The Times on 23 April 1983 he wrote:\n\nA colour photograph of a balding and grey haired man facing the camera\nGerhard Weinberg, who considered the diaries genuine when verifying them for Newsweek, and then changed his mind\nI am now satisfied that the documents are authentic; that the history of their wanderings since 1945 is true; and that the standard accounts of Hitler's writing habits, of his personality, and even, perhaps, of some public events may, in consequence, have to be revised.[98]\n\nThe day after Trevor-Roper gave his opinion of authenticity, Rupert Murdoch and his negotiation team arrived in Zürich. A deal was provisionally agreed for $2.5 million for the US serialisation rights, with an additional $750,000 for British and Commonwealth rights. While the discussions between Murdoch and Sorge were taking place, the diaries were examined by Broyle and his Newsweek team. After lengthy negotiation Broyle was informed that the minimum price Stern would consider was $3 million; the Americans returned home, informing Hensmann that they would contact him by phone in two days.[99] When Broyle contacted the Germans he offered the amount, subject to authentication by their chosen expert, Gerhard Weinberg. In 1952 Weinberg, a cautious and careful historian, had written the Guide to Captured German Documents, for use by the US military; the work is described by Hamilton as definitive in its scope of the subject.[100] Weinberg travelled to Zürich and, like Trevor-Roper, was impressed and reassured by the range of items on show; he was also partly persuaded by Trevor-Roper's endorsement of the diaries' authenticity.[101] Weinberg commented that \"the notion of anyone forging hundreds, even thousands of pages of handwriting was hard to credit\".[100] He had some reservations over the material and said he \"would feel more comfortable if a German expert on the Third Reich who has already made his reputation had been brought in to look at the material\".[102] He also stated that \"There is still room—however unlikely—for suspecting that the whole thing is a hoax. An obvious motive would be money. Another would be an attempt to rehabilitate Hitler\".[102]\n\nNewsweek verbally accepted Hensmann's offer and he in turn informed Murdoch, giving him the option to raise his bid. Murdoch was furious, having considered the handshake agreement in Zürich final.[103] On 15 April 1983 Murdoch, with Mark Edmiston, the president of Newsweek, met Schulte-Hillen, who, unexpectedly and without explanation, went back on all the previous verbal—and therefore, to his mind, non-binding—agreements and told them the price was now $4.25 million. Murdoch and Edmiston refused to accede to the new price and both left. The managers of Stern, with no publishing partners, backtracked on their statements and came to a second deal with Murdoch, who drove the price down, paying $800,000 for the US rights, and $400,000 for the British and Australian rights. Further deals were done in France with Paris Match for $400,000; in Spain with Grupo Zeta for $150,000; in the Netherlands for $125,000; in Norway for $50,000; and in Italy with Panorama for $50,000. Newsweek did not enter into a deal and instead based their subsequent stories on the copies of the diaries they had seen during the negotiation period.[104]\n\nReleased to the news media; the Stern press conference\nA black-and-white photograph of a grey-haired and spectacled man in his sixties is looking at the viewer. He wear a dark suit and tie, and is holding a copy of one of the books he has written.\nThe British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper initially endorsed the diaries as genuine; his subsequent \"180-degree turn\" was not heeded by Murdoch.\nOn 22 April 1983 a press release from Stern announced the existence of the diaries and their forthcoming publication; a press conference was announced for 25 April.[105] On hearing the news from Stern, Jäckel stated that he was \"extremely sceptical\" about the diaries, while his fellow historian, Karl Dietrich Bracher of the University of Bonn also thought their legitimacy unlikely. Irving was receiving calls from international news companies—the BBC, The Observer, Newsweek, Bild Zeitung—and he was informing them all that the diaries were fakes.[106] The former German Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, also said that he could not believe the diaries were genuine.[107] The following day The Times published the news that their Sunday sister paper had the serialisation rights for the UK; the edition also carried an extensive piece by Trevor-Roper with his opinion on the authenticity and importance of the discovery. By this stage the historian had growing doubts over the diaries, which he passed on to the editor of The Times, Charles Douglas-Home. The Times editor presumed that Trevor-Roper would also contact Giles at The Sunday Times, while Trevor-Roper thought that Douglas-Home would do so; neither did. The Sunday paper thus remained oblivious to the growing concerns that the diaries might not be genuine.[108]\n\nOn the evening of 23 April the presses began rolling for the following day's edition of The Sunday Times. After an evening meeting of the editorial staff, Giles phoned Trevor-Roper to ask him to write a piece rebutting the criticism of the diaries. He found that the historian had made \"a 180-degree turn\" regarding the diaries' authenticity, and was now far from sure that they were real. The paper's deputy editor, Brian MacArthur, rang Murdoch to see if they should stop the print run and re-write the affected pages. Murdoch's reply was \"Fuck Dacre. Publish\".[109][110]\n\nOn the afternoon of the 24 April, in Hamburg for the press conference the following day, Trevor-Roper asked Heidemann for the name of his source: the journalist refused, and gave a different story of how the diaries had been acquired. Trevor-Roper was suspicious and questioned the reporter closely for over an hour.[111] Heidemann accused the historian of acting \"exactly like an officer of the British army\" in 1945.[110] At a subsequent dinner the historian was evasive when asked by Stern executives what he was going to say at the announcement the following day.[112]\n\nAt the press conference both Trevor-Roper and Weinberg expressed their doubts at the authenticity, and stated that German experts needed to examine the diaries to confirm whether the works were genuine. Trevor-Roper went on to say that his doubts sprung from the lack of proof that these books were the same ones as had been on the crashed plane in 1945. He finished his statement by saying that \"I regret that the normal method of historical verification has been sacrificed to the perhaps necessary requirements of a journalistic scoop.\"[113] The leading article in The Guardian described his public reversal as showing \"moral courage\".[114] Irving, who had been described in the introductory statement by Koch as a historian \"with no reputation to lose\", stood at the microphone for questions, and asked how Hitler could have written his diary in the days following the 20 July plot, when his arm had been damaged. He denounced the diaries as forgeries, and held aloft the photocopied pages he had been given from Priesack. He asked if the ink in the diaries had been tested, but there was no response from the managers of Stern. Photographers and film crews jostled to get a better picture of Irving, and some punches were thrown by journalists while security guards moved in and forcibly removed Irving from the room, while he shouted \"Ink! Ink!\"[115][116][117]\n\nForensic analysis and the uncovering of the frauds\nA colour photograph of a grey-haired, thick-set man in his sixties looks directly at the viewer. He wears an open-necked short and red pullover, and holds his spectacles in front of him.\nDavid Irving (2003 photograph), who had repeatedly condemned the diaries as forgeries, endorsed them as genuine after their public release.\nWith grave doubts now expressed about the authenticity of the diaries, Stern faced the possibility of legal action for disseminating Nazi propaganda. To ensure a definitive judgment on the diaries, Hagen, one of the company's lawyers, passed three complete diaries to Henke at the Bundesarchiv for a more complete forensic examination.[118] While the debate on the diaries' authenticity continued, Stern published its special edition on 28 April, which provided Hitler's purported views on the flight of Hess to Scotland, Kristallnacht and the Holocaust.[105] The following day Heidemann again met with Kujau, and bought the last four diaries from him.[119]\n\nOn the following Sunday, 1 May 1983, The Sunday Times published further stories providing the background to the diaries, linking them more closely to the plane crash in 1945, and providing a profile of Heidemann. That day, when The Daily Express rang Irving for a further comment on the diaries, he informed them that he now believed the diaries to be genuine; The Times ran the story of Irving's U-turn the following day. Irving explained that Stern had shown him a diary from April 1945 in which the writing sloped downwards from left to right, and the script of which got smaller along the line.[120] At a subsequent press conference Irving explained that he had been examining the diaries of Dr Theodor Morell, Hitler's personal doctor, in which Morell diagnosed the Führer as having Parkinson's disease, a symptom of which was to write in the way the text appeared in the diaries.[121] Harris posits that further motives may also have played a part—the lack of reference to the Holocaust in the diaries may have been perceived by Irving as supporting evidence for his thesis, put forward in his book Hitler's War, that the Holocaust took place without Hitler's knowledge.[122]\n\nThe same day Hagen visited the Bundesarchiv and was told of their findings: ultraviolet light had shown a fluorescent element to the paper, which should not have been present in an old document, and that the bindings of one of the diaries included polyester which had not been made before 1953. Research in the archives also showed a number of errors.[123] The findings were partial only, and not conclusive; more volumes were provided to aid the analysis.[124]\n\nGenuine signature of Adolf Hitler\nGenuine Hitler signature (undated)\nForged version of Hitler's signature, showing slight differences from the original\nKujau's version of Hitler's signature, which Kenneth W. Rendell described as a \"terrible rendition\".[125]\nWhen Hagen reported back to the Stern management, an emergency meeting was called and Schulte-Hillen demanded the identity of Heidemann's source. The journalist relented, and provided the provenance of the diaries as Kujau had given it to him. Harris describes how a bunker mentality descended on the Stern management as, instead of accepting the truth of the Bundesarchiv's findings, they searched for alternative explanations as to how post-war whitening agents could have been used in the wartime paper. The paper then released a statement defending their position which Harris judges was \"resonant with hollow bravado\".[126]\n\nWhile Koch was touring the US, giving interviews to most of the major news channels, he met Kenneth W. Rendell, a handwriting expert in the studios of CBS, and showed him one of the volumes. Rendell's first impression was that the diaries were forged. He later reported that \"everything looked wrong\", including new-looking ink, poor quality paper and signatures that were \"terrible renditions\" of Hitler's.[127] Rendell concludes the diaries were not particularly good fakes, calling them \"bad forgeries but a great hoax\". He states that \"with the exception of imitating Hitler's habit of slanting his writing diagonally as he wrote across the page, the forger failed to observe or to imitate the most fundamental characteristics of his handwriting.\"[128]\n\nOn 4 May fifteen volumes of the diaries were removed from the Swiss bank vault and distributed to various forensic scientists: four went to the Bundesarchiv and eleven went to the Swiss specialists in St Gallen. The initial results were ready on 6 May, which confirmed what the forensic experts had been telling the management of Stern for the last week: the diaries were poor forgeries, with modern components and ink that was not in common use in wartime Germany. Measurements had been taken of the evaporation of chloride in the ink which showed the diaries had been written within the previous two years. There were also factual errors, including some from Domarus's Hitler: Reden und Proklamationen, 1932–45 that Kujau had copied. Before passing the news to Stern, the Bundesarchiv had already informed the government, saying it was \"a ministerial matter\". The managers at Stern tried to release the first press statement that acknowledged the forensic findings and stated that the diaries were forged, but the official government announcement was released five minutes before Stern's.[129]",

Murdoch and Edmiston refused to accede to the new price and both left.

Further deals were done in France with Paris Match for $400,000; in Spain with Grupo Zeta for $150,000; in the Netherlands for $125,000; in Norway for $50,000; and in Italy with Panorama for $50,000.

        "Document description": "The Hotsuma Tsutae (also Hotuma Tsutaye, Japanese 秀真伝) is an elaborate epic poem of Japanese legendary history which differs substantially from the mainstream version as recorded in the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki. Its antiquity is undetermined.",
        "Document claims": "Although many proponents allege that the Hotsuma predates the mainstream mythology, the first known manuscript was dedicated to a shrine by Waniko Yasutoshi (also known as Yunoshin Ibo) in 1775. Some excerpts were published and translated into modern Japanese in 1884, a printing which was noted by Hirata Atsutane in his work on jindai moji, a Japanese writing system developed prior to the use of Chinese characters, but which otherwise ignored the work. Atsutane's Kokugaku was principally concerned with the Kojiki and the Hotsuma Tsutae would have only muddled his theories. Yasutoshi's manuscript was almost lost, but was discovered and rescued in 1993 following the publication of some popular books on the subject in the mid-20th century by Yoshinosuke Matsumoto.[1][2]\n\nThe Hotsuma Tsutae is known for its text and rhythm. It was written in yamato-kotoba, which only uses a Japanese vocabulary which predates contact with China. Some of the yamato-kotoba used in Hotsuma Tsutae are unattested elsewhere in the Old Japanese corpus but have parallels to old words. Meaning that if it is a late medieval hoax, it is extremely elaborate. Among other things in its primarily historical and non-mythological record, the text discusses the births, lives, and deaths of kami from Japanese folk shrines and history; in this case, the word kami being used to mean something like royalty and not \"gods\". In the poem, Amaterasu, the sun kami of Shinto, is male, and not female as is written in the official records. Matsumoto theorizes that Amaterasu was feminized in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki to provide a justification for the reign of Empress Suiko who reigned just before those documents were written.[1][2]\n\nAlthough for the most part Japanese academics remain uninterested in this text, some scholars are of the opinion that it may have been written in the Edo period. This is due to claims that the text was written in an original Japanese alphabet - in academic circles, the existence of writing in Japan before the use of Chinese characters is denied, also the alphabet does not reflect the Old Japanese phonology but rather those of later stages of Japanese. The general opinion is that it is a false document. However, no definitive conclusion has yet been reached.",

        "Document description": "The Ireland Shakespeare forgeries were a cause célèbre in 1790s London, when author and engraver Samuel Ireland announced the discovery of a treasure-trove of Shakespearean manuscripts by his son William Henry Ireland. Among them were the manuscripts of four plays, two of them previously unknown. Upon the release of the manuscripts, such respected literary figures as James Boswell (biographer of Samuel Johnson) and poet laureate Henry James Pye pronounced them genuine, as did various antiquarian experts. Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the leading theatre manager of his day, agreed to present one of the newly discovered plays with John Philip Kemble in the starring role. Excitement over the biographical and literary significance of the find turned to acrimony, however, when it was charged that the documents were forgeries. Edmond Malone, widely regarded as the greatest Shakespeare scholar of his time, conclusively showed that the language, orthography, and handwriting were not those of the times and persons to which they were credited. William Henry Ireland, the supposed discoverer, then confessed to the fraud.",
        "Document claims": "First documents\nFrom a chance acquaintance met at a book-binder's the young man learned of a technique for simulating the appearance of ancient writing by using a special ink and then heating the paper.[6] After a trial run creating a couple of relatively insignificant documents, he set out to devise something with Shakespeare's signature. His work at a legal firm gave him access to Elizabethan and Jacobean parchment deeds, so in December 1794 he cut a piece of parchment from one of them, used his special ink to write with and heated it over a candle. The result was a mortgage deed between Shakespeare and his fellow-actor John Heminges on one side, and Michael Fraser and his wife on the other. The text and signature he copied from the facsimile of the genuine 1612 mortgage deed printed in Malone's edition of Shakespeare.[7] Ripping a seal from another early deed, young Ireland attached it to this concoction and presented the result to his father on 16 December. Samuel Ireland accepted it as authentic, and the next day took it to the Heralds' Office, which approved it as genuine.[8]\n\nAsked where he had turned up this deed, William Henry replied that he had found it in an old trunk belonging to a chance acquaintance who did not wish to have his name revealed. Mr. H., as he called him, had freely given him this deed. The young discoverer suggested that there might well be more documents where this had come from,[9] and quickly followed this up with a promissory note from Shakespeare to Heminges—the only such note (had it been genuine) ever discovered from the period.[10]\n\nFurther forgeries\nWith his next discovery William Henry moved from mere forgery to original art.[11] Having learned—apparently from a chance remark by one of his father's friends rather than by research—that Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton had been Shakespeare's patron, he decided to create correspondence between them.[12] \"Doe notte esteeme me a sluggarde nor tardye for thus havyinge delayed to answerre or rather toe thank you for youre greate Bountye,\" he has Shakespeare write sans punctuation. \"[G]ratitude is alle I have toe utter and that is tooe greate ande tooe sublyme a feeling for poore mortalls toe expresse O my Lord itte is a Budde which Bllossommes Bllooms butte never dyes.\" The Earl of Southampton replies in a similar vein, also sans punctuation, and with a similar spelling: “…as I have beene thye Freynde soe will I continue aughte thatte I canne doe forre thee praye commande me ande you shalle fynde mee Yours Southampton”.[13] To explain how both letters could end up together in the same collection William Henry added a note explaining that Shakespeare’s was a “Copye” of the letter he sent. Samuel Ireland and his friends admired the style of the letters but not the earl’s penmanship; William Henry, not knowing that handwriting of the earl was extant, had written Southampton’s reply with his left hand.[14]\n\nA flood of documents now followed, all coming from Mr. H’s ostensibly miraculous chest. Shakespeare’s “Profession of Faith” proved he was a Protestant, a letter to fellow-actor Richard Cowley showed he was \"a perfect good natured man\",[15] and a letter from Queen Elizabeth made it clear that he was favoured by the most powerful person in the land. A sketch of himself that accompanied his letter to Cowley showed that he was a wretched draftsman with an impenetrable sense of humour. Described in the letter as a \"whysycalle conceyte\", it was (as Malone put it) \"most truly whimsical, being a miserable drawing of our poet done by himself with a pen, from Martin Droeshout's print of him engraved seven years after his death….\"[16] There were also theatrical receipts, contracts, a letter and poem to his future wife, \"Anna Hatherrewaye\", and even books from Shakespeare's library, complete with marginal annotations actually signed by the bard himself. Of most interest, however, were a manuscript of King Lear Shakespeare had prepared for the press, a few stray leaves of \"Hamblette\", and two previously unknown plays, Vortigern and Rowena and Henry II.\n\nExposure\nTwo crushing blows came quickly. The first was the publication of Malone's volume of over four hundred pages on 31 March 1796. Exposing the forgeries in detail, he showed one by one that each document was flawed in its handwriting, its language, its orthography, and its history. The spelling of the documents was not only not that of Shakespeare's time, it was that of no time whatsoever. Numerous historical inaccuracies—not least of which was the reference to the Globe before that playhouse had been built—exposed the forger's ignorance. The handwriting of the Queen and Southampton did not at all resemble authentic examples. Words appearing in the forgeries (upset, for example) were not used in Shakespeare's time, or were used in a different sense than that of the papers.[33]\n\nThe second blow came two days later, on 2 April, with the failure of Vortigern at Drury Lane Theatre. The excitement was intense and the crowd volatile; tickets had sold out early and seats were hard come by. While at first the play seemed to be a success with the audience, soon fits of laughter were heard and at one point the play came to a complete halt till order was restored. When Barrymore announced another performance of the play, the audience rebelled, and chaos reigned until the management substituted something else.[34] William Henry Ireland blamed the actors, particularly Kemble, along with a \"Malone faction,\" for the failure of his play.[35] Others attributed it to the quality of the play itself.[36] Vortigern's opening night was also its final performance.\n\nAftermath\nFor the Irelands, father and son, the failure of the play, coupled with Malone's exposure of the hoax, was an unmitigated disaster. Samuel Ireland still believed the papers to be Shakespeare's, and refused to listen to anything his son had to say. William Henry confessed the forgery to his sisters, to his mother, and to Albany Wallis, but his father did not believe his story. The public, not surprisingly, accused Samuel Ireland of the fraud. Sales of his books suffered.[37]\n\nBlaming Malone for his misfortunes, Samuel Ireland set out to write a book that would destroy the scholar's reputation. With the aid of Thomas Caldecott he attacked Malone for using forensic techniques like handwriting comparison to settle a literary question, rather than relying on taste and aesthetic sensibilities.[38] Concerned for his father's reputation William Henry rushed into print with a pamphlet confessing to the forgeries, and his father replied immediately with a vindication of his conduct in the whole affair.[39] This combination roused suspicions. George Steevens accused the two of collusion:\n\nThe hopeful youth takes on himself the guilt of the entire forgery, and strains hard to exculpate his worthy father from the slightest participation in it. The father, on the contrary, declares that his son had not sufficient abilities for the execution of so difficult a task. Between them, in short, there is a pretended quarrel, that they may not look as if they were acting in concert on the present occasion.[40]\n\nThe charge would stick. George Chalmers' Apology for the Believers and Samuel Ireland's Investigation concentrated on attacking Malone rather than exonerating Samuel, and the public verdict was probably summed up in a print by John Nixon depicting the entire Ireland family engaged in forging the papers.[41]\n\nThe culpability of Samuel Ireland remained a controversial topic for years to come. Although his son's Confessions (1805) did a great deal to establish his innocence, not everybody was convinced. Accounts by Clement Mansfield Ingleby in 1859 and George Dawson in 1888 took the position that the father was responsible for the forgeries and the son's Confession was a tissue of lies. The acquisition of Samuel Ireland's papers by the British Museum in 1876, however, provided a wealth of evidence that Samuel was the victim rather than the perpetrator of the fraud, and Ingleby changed his position in his 1881 paper on the Ireland Affair.[42]\n\nLegacy\nAfter Samuel Ireland's death in 1800, the original forgeries, bound in three folio volumes, were sold to John \"Dog\" Dent, MP and bibliophile. The collections passed through several hands before being acquired by Mary Morley Crapo Hyde (1912—2003) and her first husband, Donald Hyde (1909—1966). She left the volumes to Harvard's Houghton Library after her death.[43]\n\nBritish writer Peter Ackroyd provides an imaginative account of the Irelands' forgeries in his novel The Lambs of London published by Chatto & Windus in 2004.[44] In the same year, BBC Radio 4 broadcast Martyn Wade's play about the forgeries, Another Shakespeare.[45]",

Among them were the manuscripts of four plays, two of them previously unknown.Upon the release of the manuscripts, such respected literary figures as James Boswell (biographer of Samuel Johnson) and poet laureate Henry James Pye pronounced them genuine, as did various antiquarian experts. Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the leading theatre manager of his day, agreed to present one of the newly discovered plays with John Philip Kemble in the starring role. Excitement over the biographical and literary significance of the find turned to acrimony, however, when it was charged that the documents were forgeries. Edmond Malone, widely regarded as the greatest Shakespeare scholar of his time, conclusively showed that the language, orthography, and handwriting were not those of the times and persons to which they were credited. William Henry Ireland, the supposed discoverer, then confessed to the fraud. First documents\nFrom a chance acquaintance met at a book-binder's the young man learned of a technique for simulating the appearance of ancient writing by using a special ink and then heating the paper.",

With the aid of Thomas Caldecott he attacked Malone for using forensic techniques like handwriting comparison to settle a literary question, rather than relying on taste and aesthetic sensibilities.[38] Concerned for his father's reputation William Henry rushed into print with a pamphlet confessing to the forgeries, and his father replied immediately with a vindication of his conduct in the whole affair.[39] This combination roused suspicions. George Steevens accused the two of collusion:\n\nThe hopeful youth takes on himself the guilt of the entire forgery, and strains hard to exculpate his worthy father from the slightest participation in it. The father, on the contrary, declares that his son had not sufficient abilities for the execution of so difficult a task. Between them, in short, there is a pretended quarrel, that they may not look as if they were acting in concert on the present occasion.",

Exposing the forgeries in detail, he showed one by one that each document was flawed in its handwriting, its language, its orthography, and its history. The spelling of the documents was not only not that of Shakespeare's time, it was that of no time whatsoever. Numerous historical inaccuracies—not least of which was the reference to the Globe before that playhouse had been built—exposed the forger's ignorance. The handwriting of the Queen and Southampton did not at all resemble authentic examples. Words appearing in the forgeries (upset, for example) were not used in Shakespeare's time, or were used in a different sense than that of the papers.[33]\n\nThe second blow came two days later, on 2 April, with the failure of Vortigern at Drury Lane Theatre. The excitement was intense and the crowd volatile; tickets had sold out early and seats were hard come by. While at first the play seemed to be a success with the audience, soon fits of laughter were heard and at one point the play came to a complete halt till order was restored. When Barrymore announced another performance of the play, the audience rebelled, and chaos reigned until the management substituted something else.[34] William Henry Ireland blamed the actors, particularly Kemble, along with a \"Malone faction,\" for the failure of his play.[35] Others attributed it to the quality of the play itself.[36] Vortigern's opening night was also its final performance.\n\nAftermath\nFor the Irelands, father and son, the failure of the play, coupled with Malone's exposure of the hoax, was an unmitigated disaster.",

        "Document description": "The Correspondence of (or between) Paul and Seneca, also known as the Letters of Paul and Seneca or Epistle to Seneca the Younger, is a collection of letters claiming to be between Paul the Apostle and Seneca the Younger. There are 8 epistles from Seneca, and 6 replies from Paul. They were purportedly authored from 58–64 CE during the reign of Roman Emperor Nero, but appear to have actually been written in the middle of the fourth century (~320–possibly 380 CE). Until the Renaissance, the epistles were seen as genuine, but scholars began to critically examine them in the 15th century, and today they are held to be forgeries.",
        "Document claims": "Scholars almost universally believe the correspondence to be forged.[14][note 1] During the 15th century in the Renaissance, more skeptical analysis raised doubts on the veracity of the correspondence.[5] Scholars such as Lorenzo Valla found that the writing style matched neither Seneca nor Paul, and the letters were denounced by Erasmus.[20] Later scholars detected errors of fact and chronology that the genuine Seneca would not have made, but a forger not intricately familiar with Roman history writing centuries later might have. Scholars noticed with skepticism just how late the letters appeared in history; Lactantius, a Christian author writing earlier in the 4th century, makes no mention of any such correspondence, despite frequently citing Seneca and positively evaluating both him and Paul.[2] This suggests their creation in the middle of the 4th century, such that Lactantius would have been unfamiliar, yet Jerome would think them legitimate.[1][10] The 11th letter dated to 64 CE bears a different writing style of Latin from the other letters, and is out of chronological sequence with the rest of the correspondence. This leads scholars to think that a different forger may have written that letter.[2] The 13th and 14th epistles also have a somewhat different style than the others, indicating they too may have been appended later.[10] Additionally, the 14th epistle is unusually direct about Paul's evangelism, with him calling on Seneca to \"make yourself a new herald of Jesus Christ\",[21] yet Jerome only quotes the 12th epistle in support of listing Seneca as a saint, leading to suspicion that the version of the correspondence Jerome read in the late 4th century did not yet include the final two letters.[11] The motive of the forger is unknown. J. B. Lightfoot wrote that it was likely \"either to recommend Seneca to Christian readers or to recommend Christianity to students of Seneca,\"[5] a position that Adolf von Harnack agreed with.[14] Claude Barlow thought that the writings might have been a rhetorical exercise; essentially, a fictional essay by a novice writer practicing their craft that escaped to readers who did not realize its origins.[22] J. K. Elliott wrote that it was \"to show the superiority of Christianity over pagan philosophy.\"[10] Bart Ehrman suggests that the creation of the letters may have been part of early Christian apologia. In this theory, a Roman pagan polemic against Christianity was the claim that Paul was not particularly significant in his era. The forger accepted the somewhat elitist terms of this argument – that only \"great\" people deserve to be listened to – and responded by having the greatest philosopher of Paul's day endorse and praise Paul, so mere flattery was enough to serve the purpose of the apologist.[14] Critics generally deride the worth of the correspondence as well for not including much of anything interesting, such as a debate on the merits of Stoicism, Christianity, or even just court gossip.[2] Erasmus wrote that \"I do not see how he could have made these letters in a more feeble or insipid fashion.\"[14] Philip Schaff in his History of the Christian Church said that \"They are very poor in thought and style, full of errors of chronology and history, and undoubtedly a forgery.\"[23] J. B. Lightfoot was caustic about the overall worth of the correspondence, criticizing \"the poverty of thought and style, the errors in chronology and history, and the whole conception of the relative positions of the Stoic philosopher and the Christian Apostle\" which \"betray clearly the hand of a forger.\"[24] As they are now universally allowed to be spurious, it will be unnecessary to state at length the grounds of their condemnation. It is sufficient to say that the letters are inane and unworthy throughout; that the style of either correspondent is unlike his genuine writings; that the relations between the two, as there represented, are highly improbable; and lastly, that the chronological notices (which however are absent in some important [manuscripts]) are wrong in almost every instance. Thus, independently of the unbroken silence of three centuries and a half about this correspondence, internal evidence alone is sufficient to condemn them hopelessly.[5] — J. B. Lightfoot, Dissertations on the Apostolic Age, The Letters of Paul and Seneca\nAccording to the Italian historian Marta Sordi, it is probable that Seneca had a personal knowledge of St Paul, taking into account that: contacts between Paul and the gens Annaea are documented since the first century; when Paul arrived in Rome between 56 and 58, Seneca was the most powerful man after Nero; Paul had friends among the praetorians, including Afranius Burrus, himself a friend of Seneca; Seneca's brother had intervened on Paul's behalf.[25]",

        "Document description": "Kujiki (旧事紀), or Sendai Kuji Hongi (先代旧事本紀), is a historical Japanese text. It was generally believed to have been one of the earliest Japanese histories until the middle of the Edo period, when scholars such as Tokugawa Mitsukuni and Tada Yoshitoshi successfully contended that it was an imitation based on the Nihon Shoki, the Kojiki and the Kogo Shūi.[1] Scholarship on the Kujiki generally considers it to contain some genuine elements, specifically that Book 5 preserves traditions of the Mononobe and Owari clans, and that Book 10 preserves the earlier historical record the Kokuzō Hongi.[2]\n\nTen volumes in length, it covers the history of ancient Japan through Empress Suiko, third daughter of Emperor Kinmei. The preface is supposedly written by Soga no Umako (+626). While it includes many quotes from Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720), volumes five and ten contain unique materials. The overall composition is considered as having been compiled between 807 and 936.",

        "Page URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudabiliter",
        "Document description": "Laudabiliter was a bull issued in 1155 by Pope Adrian IV, the only Englishman to have served in that office. Existence of the bull has been disputed by scholars over the centuries; no copy is extant but scholars cite the many references to it as early as the 13th century to support the validity of its existence.[1][page needed] The bull purports to grant the right to the Angevin King Henry II of England to invade and govern Ireland and to enforce the Gregorian Reforms on the semi-autonomous Christian Church in Ireland. Richard de Clare (\"Strongbow\") and the other leaders of the Norman invasion of Ireland (1169 – 71) claimed that Laudabiliter authorised the invasion. These Cambro-Norman knights were retained by Diarmuid MacMorrough, the deposed King of Leinster, as an ally in his fight with the High King of Ireland, Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair. Successive kings of England, from Henry II (1171) until Henry VIII (1541), used the title Lord of Ireland and claimed that it had been conferred by Adrian's successor, Pope Alexander III (c. 1100/1105 – 1181). After almost four centuries of the Lordship, the declaration of the independence of the Church of England from papal supremacy and the rejection of the authority of the Holy See required the creation of a new basis to legitimise the continued rule of the English monarch in Ireland. In 1542, the Crown of Ireland Act was passed by both the English and Irish parliaments. The Act established a sovereign Kingdom of Ireland with Henry as King of Ireland. A competing, Catholic claim to sovereignty in Ireland was issued in 1555, through Pope Paul IV's bull \"Ilius, per quem Reges regnant\", which bestowed the crown of the Kingdom on Philip II of Spain and Mary I of England.[2]",
        "Document claims": "According to Curtis for the text of the Laudabiliter we only have Giraldus Cambrensis' Conquest of Ireland written around 1188, though in it his dating is not accurate, he says he must have had some such \"genuine document before him\". He suggests that better evidence for the grant of Ireland can be found in John of Salisbury's Metalogicus, written about 1159.[5]\n\nJohn of Salisbury\nAt the beginning of his reign, Henry II sent Rotrodus, Bishop of Evreux, Arnold, Bishop of Lisieux, the Bishop of Le Mans and Robert of Gorham, Abbot of St. Albans as ambassadors to Adrian IV.[18] The date of this mission is the same as that claimed by Salisbury for his visit, 1155. Alfread H. Tarleton gives the date of 9 October, St. Dionysius's day, when the ambassadors set out.[19] L. F. Rushbrook Williams also gives 9 October 1155.[20] While both mention Robert of Gorham assisting in some royal business and being a part of deputation including three bishops selected by Henry neither mention John of Salisbury. However, John D. Hosler thinks \"It is clear that John of Salibury did indeed travel to Rome as part of Henry's first embassy to Pope Adrian.[21]\n\nAccording to L. F. Rushbrook Williams, Abbot Robert of Gorham evidently saw with the elevation of Adrian IV an opportunity of acquiring privileges for St. Albans with the ostensible object of assisting in the settlement of some royal business which was in progress at the curia.[22] Alfread H Tarleton suggests that some historians have stated that John of Salisbury accompanied this mission but this is a mistake, based on a confusion of the fact that John had many interviews with the Pope at Beneventum. The mistake may be due to the fact that the King, hearing John intended to visit the Pope, sent messages and letters through him in addition to employing a regular messenger, in the person of Robert the Abbot.[23]\n\nGasquet suggests that there is almost conclusively evidence, that while a request of the nature described by Salisbury was made about this time to the Pope, Salisbury was not the envoy sent to make it.[24] John of Salisbury, he notes, claims in Metalogicus to have been the ambassador for Henry II and obtained Laudabiliter for him and gives the year 1155 as the date when it was granted. With Bernard of Clairvaux's Life of Malachy and its description of the Irish as little more than savages, John of Salisbury found a ready audience in Rome when he spoke about the barbaric and impious people of Ireland.[7]\n\nSalisbury finished his work called Polycraticus, written before Metalogicus he dedicated it to Thomas Becket, then Chancellor of England and later a saint, who at this time was with Henry at the siege of Toulouse. This was in 1159; and in that year, Salisbury was presented to Henry apparently for the first time, by Thomas.[25]\n\nMetalogicus and Polycraticus\nAccording to Stephen J. McCormick, the date that Metalogicus was written is fixed according to the author himself, pointing to the fact that John of Salisbury immediately before he tells us that the news of Pope Adrian's death had reached him his own patron, Theobald of Bec, Archbishop of Canterbury, though still living, was \"weighed down by many infirmities.\" Pope Adrian died in 1159 he says and the death of Archbishop, Theobald of Bec occurred in 1161. Gile and other editors of John of Salisbury's works, without a dissent, refer the Metalogicus to the year 1159, a view shared by Curtis.[26][27]\n\nJohn of Salisbury, in his Metalogicus (lib. iv., cap. 42) writes, that while he was in an official capacity at the Papal Court, in 1155, Pope Adrian IV, granted the investiture of Ireland Henry II of England. However, John of Salisbury also kept a diary, later published, entitled Polycraticus and had a detailed account of the various incidents of his embassy to Pope Adrian, yet in it he makes no mention of the Bull, or of the gold ring and its fine emerald, mentioned in Metalogicus or of the grant of Ireland, all of which would have been so important for his narrative in Metalogicus.[26] If Adrian granted this Bull to Henry at the solicitation of John of Salisbury in 1155 there is but one explanation for the silence in Polycraticus, according to McCormick and that this secrecy was required by the English monarch.[28]\n\nJ. Duncan Mackie writes that those who desire to do away altogether with Laudabiliter, find in the last chapter of the sixth book of the Metalogicus, an account of the transaction between John and Pope Adrian and in this passage is an almost insurmountable difficulty. It become necessary he says to assume that it is an interpolation, and this can only be done \"in the face of all probability.\"[29]\n\nGiraldus Cambrensis\nJohn of Salisbury, speaking of the existence of Laudabiliter in the last chapter of the Metalogicus does not give its text and it was at least thirty years after Adrian's death that the Laudabiliter itself first appeared in the Expugnatio Hibernica of Giraldus Cambrensis.[30]\n\nOliver Joseph Thatcher suggests that the trustworthiness of Giraldus, to whom he says we owe Laudabiliter preservation, has nothing to do with the question of its genuineness, and should be left out of the discussion.[30] However, Thomas Moore says the character of the man himself ought to be taken into account,[31] and Michael Richter says that as no copy of the text survives, the issue becomes the credibility of those authors who recorded it on their works.[32]\n\nAccording to Thatcher, Giraldus Cambrensis apparently drew a false inference from John of Salisbury's works by saying that John went as the king's ambassador to the pope. Thatcher notes that other historians have since then unthinkingly copied this statement.[30]\n\nGiraldus first published Expugnatio Hibernica around the year 1188. According to Gasquet every subsequent English chronicler who mentions Laudabiliter has simply accepted it on Giraldus's authority.[33] James F. Dimock notes that some late Irish writers seemed to him to put more faith in Giraldus's history than it really deserves.[34] Dimock, who edited Giraldi Cambrensis Opera, says that De Expugnatione Hiberniae is, in great measure, rather \"a poetical fiction than a prosaic truthful history.\"[35]\n\nDate the Bull was produced\nOn the question of the date when Laudabiliter was first publicized, most of those who deny its authenticity believe that it was first made known about 1180 according to Ginnell.[36] Ua Clerigh believes Laudabiliter was probably prepared in 1156, but not forwarded at that time because the offer of Adrian was not then acted on, though the investiture was accepted.[10]\n\nAccording to Burke, in the year 1174 King Henry II produced Laudabiliter which he said he got from Pope Adrian IV, permitting him to go to Ireland.[37] For twenty years, according to McCormick, that is from 1155 to 1175, there was no mention of the gift of Adrian. Henry did not refer to it when authorising his vassals to join Dermot MacMurrough in 1167, or when he himself set out for Ireland to receive the homage of the Irish princes and not even after he assumed his new title and accomplished the purpose of his expedition.[28]\n\nCurtis, however, while accepting that it is true that the Laudabiliter was not published by Henry when in Ireland, that can be explained by his being alienated from Rome over the murder of Thomas Becket, in addition to the Empress Matilda's having protested against this invasion of Ireland.[5] The date, Burke writes, that was on Laudabiliter was 1154, therefore it was consequently twenty years old. During this twenty-year period nobody ever heard of this Laudabiliter except Henry, and it was said that Henry kept this a secret, because his mother, the Empress Matilda, did not want Henry to act on it.[37]\n\nThe Synod of Cashel in 1172, McCormick notes was the first Episcopal assembly after Henry's arrival in Ireland. The Papal Legate was present and had Adrian's Bull existed it should necessarily have engaged the attention of the assembled Fathers. However, \"not a whisper\" as to Adrian's grant he says was to be heard at that Council. Even the learned editor of Cambrensis Eversus Dr. Kelly, while asserting the genuineness of Adrian's Bull, admits \"there is not any, even the slightest authority, for asserting that its existence was known in Ireland before the year 1172, or for three years later\".[28][36]\n\nMcCormick says that it is extremely difficult, in any hypothesis, to explain in a satisfactory way this silence, nor is it easy to understand how a fact so important to the interests of Ireland could remain so many years concealed, including from those in the Irish Church. Throughout this period he says, Ireland numbered among its Bishops one who held the important office of Legate of the Holy See, and that the Church had had constant intercourse with England and the continent through St Laurence O'Toole and a hundred other distinguished Prelates, who enjoyed in the fullest manner the confidence of Rome.[28]\n\nEvidence for the bull\nThat an actual bull was sent is not doubted by many and its authenticity has been questioned without success according to P. S. O'Hegarty who suggests that the question now is purely an academic one.[38]\n\nRadulfus de Diceto, Dean of London, and those of Roger de Wendover and Matthew Paris in which Laudabiliter is cited as a Bull.[26][39]\nIn 1331 the Justiciar and Council of Ireland wrote to Pope John XXII asking him to proclaim a crusade against some Irish clans, basing their request on their understanding that: \"... the holy apostolic see in the time of Pope Adrian of blessed memory conceded the land to the illustrious king of the English...\". The request was refused.[40]\n\nFour letters of Pope Alexander III\n\nPope Alexander III\nOn the conclusion of the Synod of Cashel according to Edmund Curtis, Henry sent envoys to Pope Alexander III asking for a papal privilege for Ireland. Alexander from Tusculum then published three letters on the Irish question.[41] The three letters, according to Thatcher, are numbered 12,162, 12,163, and 12,164 in the Regesta of Jaffé-Loewenfeld, and printed in Migne, Patrologia Latina, Vol, CC, cols. 883 ff. They all have the same date, 20 September, and it is certain, he says, that they were written in 1172.[42] Cardinal Gasquet writes that they were first published in 1728 by Hearne in the Liber Niger Scaccarii the Black Book of the Exchequer and are addressed to the Irish Bishops, to the English king, and to the Irish princes. While they all have the same date of 20 September, and are written from Tusculum, he suggest that they are attributed to the year 1170.[43]\n\nIn the letter to Henry, according to Thatcher, Alexander beseeches Henry to preserve whatever rights St. Peter already actually exercises in Ireland, and expresses confidence that Henry will be willing to acknowledge his duty. In this letter, Thatcher notes, there is no mention of Adrian IV., or any document issued by him, and there is nothing that can possibly be interpreted as a reference to Laudabiliter.[44]\n\n\nLaurence Ginnell (1854–1923)\nOn the letters of Alexander III, Cardinal Gasquet cites the editor of the Analecta who notes that they completely ignore the existence of Laudabiliter. The letters, he says, recognise no title or claim of Henry to dominion except \"the power of the monarch, and the submission of the chiefs.\" They do mention the Pope's rights over all islands, and ask Henry to preserve these rights. This proves, he says, that the grant of Adrian was unknown in Rome as completely as it was in England and Ireland. Such a deduction is confirmed, he says, by the action later of Pope John XXII with the Ambassadors of Edward II at the beginning of the 14th century. Although the author of the article in the Analecta does not agree with Dr. Moran as to the authentic character of these documents, he admits that they, at least, form some very powerful arguments against the genuineness of Pope Adrian's grant.[43]\n\nCiting Matthew of Westminster, Father Burke notes that \"Henry obliged every man in England, from the boy of twelve years up to the old man, to renounce their allegiance to the true Pope, and go over to an anti-Pope\"; and asks whether it was likely that Alexander would give Henry a letter to settle ecclesiastical matters in Ireland. Father Burke, citing Alexander who wrote to Henry, notes that instead of referring to a document giving him permission to settle Church matters in Ireland Alexander said:[45]\n\nInstead of remedying the disorders caused by your predecessors, you have oppressed the Church, and you have endeavored to destroy the canons of apostolic men.\n\n\nJames Anthony Froude\nHowever, Curtis in his History of Ireland suggests that Henry was at this time in May 1172 reconciled with the Papacy.[41] Father Burke notes that Alexander's letter carried the date 1172 and asked was is it likely that the Pope would have given a letter to Henry, asking him to take care of the Church and put everything in order?[45]\n\nBurke points out that Adrian did not know Henry, but Alexander knew him well. Henry, he says, in 1159 supported the anti-Pope, Octavianus, against Alexander and opposed him again in 1166, this time supporting the anti-Pope Guido. Father Burke then asks, \"is this the man that Alexander would send to Ireland to settle affairs, and make the Irish good children of the Pope?\" Responding again to Froude, who then said that \"the Irish never loved the Pope till the Normans taught them,\" Father Burke notes that until \"the accursed Normans came to Ireland\", the Papal Legate could always come and go as he pleased and that no Irish king obstructed him and that no Irishman's hand was ever raised against a bishop, \"much less against the Papal Legate\". However, of the very first Legate that came to Ireland after the Norman Invasion, Father Burke writes, in passing through England, Henry \"took him by the throat, and imposed upon him an oath that, when he went to Ireland, he would not do anything that would be against the interest of the King\". It was unheard of that a bishop, archbishop, or cardinal should be persecuted, Burke says, until the Anglo-Normans brought with them \"their accursed feudal system, and concentration of power in the hands of the king\".[46]\n\nAccording to Curtis, the Pope sent another privilege which was published by papal envoys after the Synod of Waterford, which he said conferred on Henry the dominion over the Irish people. Whatever we may think of the so-called Bull of Adrian, says Curtis, there can be no doubt that the letters and privilege of Alexander conferred the lordship of Ireland upon Henry II.[41] Herbert Paul says that James Anthony Froude also maintained that the existence of Laudabiliter was proved by this later letter.[47] However, Father Burke said that he preferred to believe that it was a forgery.[45]\n\nControversy\nThe controversy regarding Laudabiliter generally focusses on one of three perspectives: the document is authentic; it is a forgery, or it is a modified version of the original.[5]\n\nIn favor of authenticity\nJohn Lingard, John Lanigan, Stephen J. McCormick, and P. S. O'Hegarty have defended the authenticity of the Laudabiliter, and English writers generally have accepted it as genuine.[38][48] According to Ginnell, Sylvester Malone, D.D., Vicar General of Killaloe, was the most strenuous upholder of both letters.[49] English historians according to Gasquet, have universally taken the genuineness of the document for granted.[24] Michael Richter concludes the bull is authentic.\n\nGinnell notes the entire absence of any mention in Scottish Gaelic writings.[49] However, Arthur Ua Clerigh argues in favor of the bull based upon a text of Laudabiliter in the Book of Leinster. To the text of the bull are prefixed the following headings: \"Ah! men of the faith of the world, how beautiful [so far Gaelic] when over the cold sea in ships Zephyrus wafts glad tidings\" [Latin] a Bull granted to the King of the English on the collation, i.e. grant, of Hibernia, in which nothing is derogated from the rights of the Irish, as appears by the words of the text. Ua Clerigh holds this was almost certainly written, and probably by his old tutor Aedh McCrimthainn, during the lifetime of Diarmaid MacMurchada, who was banished in 1157, and died in 1171.[50]\n\nIrish historians who have accepted John of Salisbury's account of Laudabiliter suggest that Adrian was purposely deceived as to the state of Ireland at the time thus giving rise to the necessity of the English interference by the king, and have regarded the \"Bull\" as a document granted in error as to the real circumstances of the case.[24]\n\nWriting about the 1317 Remonstrance (see below), the historian J. R. S. Phillips has said that \"it demonstrates that in the early fourteenth century Pope Adrian IV’s bull Laudabiliter, in which he had urged Henry II of England to conquer Ireland, was regarded even by enemies of the English as a key element in the English monarchy’s claims to the lordship of Ireland\".[51]\n\nAgainst authenticity\nGoddard Henry Orpen notes that as early as 1615 Laudabiliter was denounced as a forgery by Stephen White, to be followed by John Lynch in 1662 and later still by Abbé Mac Geoghegan. Francis Aidan Gasquet writes that during the residence of the pontifical Court at Avignon two Lives of Pope Adrian IV were written. One was composed in 1331 and the second in 1356. In neither is there any mention of this important act of the Pope, although the authors find a place for many less important documents.[43]\n\nThomas N. Burke O.P., in his English Misrule in Ireland: A Course of Lectures in Reply to J. A Froude, puts forward a number of arguments against both the Bull of Adrian and the letters of his successor, Pope Alexander III. Burke questions the date on Laudabiliter, in addition to the terms contained in it and how it was obtained, questioning also the date in which it was first produced by Henry and why.[52] Patrick Francis Moran also disputed the bull's authenticity in a November 1872 article in the Irish Ecclesiastical Record.[53]\n\nProfessor Anne Duggan's research indicates that Laudabiliter is a falsification of an existing letter and that was not in fact Adrian's intention to grant Henry the rights he claimed.[54]\n\nIn favor of an edited version\nA number of scholars have drawn a distinction between the letter given to John of Salisbury and the subsequent bull Laudabiliter.\n\nAccording to Arthur Ua Clerigh, the letter referred to was not Laudabiliter, but a formal letter of investiture, such as was used in the case of Robert Guiscard in Italy.[10] Historian Paul Scheffer-Boichorst regards the donation as indisputable, while rejecting Laudabiliter as a forgery,[55] as does Felix Liebermann.[56] Oliver Joseph Thatcher's Studies Concerning Adrian IV; I. The Offer of Ireland to Henry II, reproduces the arguments of Boichorst.[10]\n\nTextual scholar Anne Duggan of King's College, London, is of the opinion that Laudabiliter is a falsification of a genuine letter, now lost. Professor Duggan demonstrated that arranging the paragraphs in a more conventional manner, reveals a more cautious statement that \"fits very closely with a known letter of Adrian IV, advising the kings of France and England not to go forward with a planned crusade to Spain unless they consulted the ‘princes, churches and people of the region’\". Duggan suggests that Adrian IV did not wish to alienate the most powerful prince in Europe, but insisted on the consent of the Irish.[57]\n\nGinnell has written that those who accept Laudabiliter as authentic can be equally divided on its significance. Some use it with the object of exposing the Papacy's venality, corruption, and \"ingratitude towards mankind in general, and towards faithful Ireland in particular\" while others cite it as proof that Ireland has always been the object of the \"Pope's special paternal care.\"[58] Another argument, again assuming the authenticity of Laudabiliter, is that it would be tantamount to the Pope having made a shockingly bad choice of an instrument in Henry II for reducing Ireland to law and order.[58]\n\nPapal copy of Laudabiliter\nCaesar Baronius, in his work, the Annales Ecclesiastici, groups the Laudabiliter in an appendix of doubtful documents. He indicated that he derived it from the Codex Vaticanus, but in such condition that he could not determine its date. Patrick F. Moran determined that the codex mentioned was a manuscript copy of a history by Matthew of Paris, which he copied from Roger de Wendover's Chronica which included a copy of Giraldus.[59]\n\nCurtis in his A History of Ireland from Earliest Times to 1922 states that there is no original or copy of Laudabiliter in the papal archives.[5] While accepting that there is no copy of Laudabiliter in the papal archives Mackie suggests that this proves nothing, for there is at Rome no document dealing with the affairs of Ireland before the year 1215.[60]\n\nSynod of Waterford 1175\nGerald of Wales asserts the Bulls of Adrian and Alexander were read at a meeting of Bishops in Waterford in 1175, during which Laudabiliter was used by the Papacy as evidence showing the clergy of England and Ireland were solely under papal supremacy.[61]\n\nTerms of Laudabiliter\nADRIAN, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to his most dearly beloved son in Christ, the illustrious king of the English, greeting and apostolical blessing.\n\n...You have signified to us, our well-beloved son in Christ, that you propose to enter the island of Ireland in order to subdue the people and make them obedient to laws, and to root out from among them the weeds of sin; and that you are willing to yield and pay yearly from every house the pension of one penny to St Peter, and to keep and preserve the rights of the churches in that land whole and inviolate.\n\nWe, therefore, regarding your pious and laudable design with due favour, and graciously assenting to your petition, do hereby declare our will and pleasure, that, for the purpose of enlarging the borders of the Church, setting bounds to the progress of wickedness, reforming evil manners, planting virtue, and increasing the Christian religion, you do enter and take possession of that island, and execute therein whatsoever shall be for God's honour and the welfare of the same.\n\nAnd, further, we do also strictly charge and require that the people of that land shall accept you with all honour, and dutifully obey you, as their liege lord, saving only the rights of the churches, which we will have inviolably preserved; and reserving to St Peter and the holy Roman Church the yearly pension of one penny from each house. If, therefore, you bring your purpose to good effect, let it be your study to improve the habits of that people, and take such orders by yourself, or by others whom you shall think fitting, for their lives, manners and conversation, that the Church there may be adorned by them, the Christian faith be planted and increased, and all that concerns the honour of God and the salvation of souls be ordered by you in like manner; so that you may receive at God's hands the blessed reward of everlasting life, and may obtain on earth a glorious name in ages to come.[62]\n\nParaphrased, the terms of the Bull Laudabiliter are that:\n\nThe Pope grants the King of England the right to \"enter and take possession of\" Ireland for God's honour and the welfare of Ireland.\nThe Irish people are to accept the King of England with all honour and obey him dutifully as their liege lord, with the exception that the rights of the churches of Ireland are to be \"inviolably preserved\".\nThe Papacy and Church of Rome are to receive one penny a year from each house in Ireland.\nThe King of England is charged to improve the habits of the people of Ireland, particularly their lives, manners and conversation.\nThe King of England is charged to ensure that the Christian Church is adopted by the people of Ireland, and the Christian faith \"planted and increased\".\nPapal letter of 1311 and the Irish Kings' Remonstrance of 1317\n\nPope John XXII\nWithin a century-and-a-half, Norman misrule in Ireland became so apparent that Laudabiliter was to be invoked again, this time in aid of the rights of the Gaelic Irish clans. Pope Clement V had written to Edward II of England in 1311 reminding him of the responsibility that Laudabiliter put upon him to execute government in Ireland for the welfare of the Irish. He warned Edward II that:\n\n... the kings of England ... have in direct violation of [Laudabiliter], for a long period past kept down that people [of Ireland] in a state of intolerable bondage, accompanied with unheard-of hardships and grievances. Nor was there found during all that time, any person to redress the grievances they endured or be moved with a pitiful compassion for their distress; although recourse was had to you ... and the loud cry of the oppressed fell, at times at least, upon your own ear. In consequence whereof, unable to support such a state of things any longer, they have been compelled to withdraw themselves from your jurisdiction and to invite another to come and be ruler over them ...\n\nAfter the excommunicated Robert the Bruce[63] defeated King Edward II of England at Bannockburn, his younger brother Edward launched an invasion of Ireland, in 1316. Edward's Gaelic allies, before their defeat and the death of the Bruce, at the Battle of Faughart in 1318, enclosed a copy of Laudabiliter on a Remonstrance sent to Pope John XXII, requesting the bull be revoked and the papacy recognise Edward Bruce as King of Ireland. Led by Domnall mac Brian Ó Néill and Tír Eógain, their petition was refused:\n\n... in the year of the Lord 1155, at the false and wicked representation of King Henry of England, under whom and perhaps by whom St. Thomas of Canterbury, as you know, in that very year suffered death for justice and defence of the church, Pope Adrian, your predecessor, an Englishman not so much by birth as by feeling and character, did in fact, but unfairly, confer upon that same Henry (whom for his said offence he should rather have been deprived of his own kingdom) this lordship of ours by a certain form of words, the course of justice entirely disregarded and the moral vision of that great pontiff blinded, alas! by his English proclivities.\n\nOne could interpret this to mean that the kings believed that Laudabiliter was the ultimate legal basis for their continuing problems at that time.[64] In the meantime they had misremembered the year of Becket's death (1170, not 1155), but painfully recalled the date of Laudabiliter. In its date, style and contents the Remonstrance argues against the attempts to negate the bull centuries later. It is also clear from these documents that Clement V wanted Edward II to promote a more tolerant administration in Ireland, but without going so far as to revoke the bull of 1155. Given that he was a Pope during the controversial Avignon Papacy, John XXII was not in a position to alienate the support of kings such as Edward II.\n\nLaudabiliter and the Kingdom of Ireland 1542–1555\nLaudabiliter had a continuing political relevance into the 16th century. Henry VIII of England was excommunicated by Pope Paul III on 17 December 1538, causing his opponents to question his continuing claim to be Lord of Ireland, which was based ultimately on Laudabiliter. Henry established the Kingdom of Ireland in 1542, whereby the kingdom was to be ruled in \"personal union\" with the Kingdom of England. This was not recognised by Europe's Roman Catholic monarchs. Therefore, in 1555 a further papal bull Ilius, per quem Reges regnant was issued by Pope Paul IV naming Queen Mary and her husband Philip (later Philip II of Spain) as monarchs of Ireland.[65]",

This proves, he says, that the grant of Adrian was unknown in Rome as completely as it was in England and Ireland. Such a deduction is confirmed, he says, by the action later of Pope John XXII with the Ambassadors of Edward II at the beginning of the 14th century. Although the author of the article in the Analecta does not agree with Dr. Moran as to the authentic character of these documents, he admits that they, at least, form some very powerful arguments against the genuineness of Pope Adrian's grant.",

The document called for a second Norman conquest of England, with an invading army led by the Duke of Normandy (later king John II of France), and England was to be divided between the Duke of Normandy and his nobles as a fief for the King of France.[1] It would have been discovered by the English army at Caen, following the Battle of Caen in 1346 that ensued from the English invasion of Normandy. The Earl of Huntingdon brought the document to England after he was invalided home and it was read out in St. Paul's Cathedral in London by the Archbishop of Canterbury, John de Stratford.[2] The document was also exhibited in Parliament on 8 September 1346, which was summoned to vote supplies to the king, who was engaged in the Siege of Calais.[3] It was claimed that King Philip vowed to \"destruire & anientier tote la Nation & la Lange Engleys\" [destroy and ruin the entire English nation and country].[a][6] However some scholars believe the letter to have been forged.[7]",

        "Document description": "The Bat Creek inscription is an inscribed stone tablet found by John W. Emmert on February 14, 1889.[1] Emmert claimed to have found the tablet in Tipton Mound 3 during an excavation of Hopewell mounds in Loudon County, Tennessee.[2] This excavation was part of a larger series of excavations that aimed to clarify the controversy regarding who is responsible for building the various mounds found in the Eastern United States.[1]\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, when the tablet was found, Cyrus Thomas, the director of the mound excavations, concluded the inscription presented letters from the Cherokee alphabet.[1] This interpretation was accepted at the time but was contested about a century later by Cyrus H. Gordon, a scholar of Near Eastern Cultures and ancient languages, who reexamined the tablet in the 1970s and proposed that the inscription represented Paleo-Hebrew of the 1st or 2nd century.[1] The consensus among archaeologists is that the tablet is a hoax,[1][3] although some have argued that the ancient Hebrew text on the stone supports pre-Columbian transoceanic contact theories.[4] Countering the notion of pre-Columbian transoceanic contact theories, archaeologists Robert Mainfort and Mary Kwas have concluded that the inscription is not a genuine paleo-Hebrew artifact but rather a 19th-century forgery.[1][3] Furthermore, the conclusions drawn by Mainfort and Kwas have been accepted by other archaeologists and members of academic communities.[5]\n\nToday the probable source used by the forger to create the inscription has been identified, yet the question of who made the tablet and why remains unanswered.[1]",
        "Document claims": "In the 1894 Report on the Mound Explorations of the Bureau of Ethnology, the inscription was first officially mentioned along with other artifacts recovered from the Bat Creek Mound excavations.[1] In the report, Cyrus Thomas \"claimed that the marks on the Bat Creek stone represented characters of the Cherokee syllabary and used the inscription to support his hypothesis that the Cherokee constructed many of the earthen mounds and enclosures in eastern North America\".[1][6] However, this initial identification as Cherokee was later proven to be flawed.[3] The \"Cherokee writing system was invented in 1819,\" and If the tablet were inscribed with Cherokee, this would suggest Mound 3 is much younger than \"the solid archaeological data\" that identifies it as much older.[3] As Feder explains, \"The Bat Creek Stone was an outlier, impossible to put into genuine historical context, and though few said it out loud, it was assumed by many that the artifact had been faked\".[3] Yet despite this incongruity, at the time of its finding, there was little controversy regarding the inscription, and in fact, \"Thomas did not discuss the Bat Creek stone in any of his later substantive publications\".[1] But this accord was broken in the 1970s when the Bat Creek Inscription was adopted by proponents of Pre-Columbian transatlantic contact theories. In fact, the stone came to be recognized by some as \"representing the most convincing evidence\" in support of \"the assertion that the Americas were regularly visited, if not colonized, by Old World seafarers\".[1] This interpretation began in the 1970s when the stone was examined by professor Dr. Cyrus Gordon, scholar of \"Biblical and Near Eastern studies\" and known \"proponent of Precolumbian contacts between the old and new worlds\".[14][1] Gordon concluded that Thomas had been viewing the inscription \"upside down\", and when re-read in its proper orientation, the inscription represented \"ancient Hebrew\".[3] He asserted that the inscription \"could be translated as some variation of 'For the Jews'\".[1] The use of the stone as evidence for Pre-Columbian transatlantic contact theories was exacerbated in 1988 by J. Huston McCulloch, Economics professor at Ohio State University.[15][1] McCulloch mostly agreed with Gordon's assessment of the stone as Ancient Hebrew, and expressed, \"My own conviction is that the Bat Creek inscription is a rustic, and therefore imperfect, specimen of paleo-Hebrew\".[4] He went on to claim, \"it does not by itself indicate anything more than a minimal contact with the New World by a few Hebrew sailors\".[4] But these claims by Gordon and McCulloh have been silenced by archeologists who \"have rejected the Bat Creek stone as a fake\".\n\n\nMasonic artist's impression of Biblical phrase 𐤒𐤃𐤔 𐤋𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 (QDSh LYHWH) in paleo-Hebrew script (Macoy 1868: 134), compared with the inscribed stone.\nRobert Mainfort and Mary Kwas concluded the inscription is not genuine paleo-Hebrew but rather a 19th-century forgery, and other respected archaeologists such as Kenneth Feder have supported the claim that the tablet is a fraud.[5] Mainfort and Kwas have identified the source of the inscription. It was most likely copied from the General History, Cyclopedia, and Dictionary of Freemasonry.[1] This specific volume was \"extensively reprinted during the latter half of the nineteenth century\", and would have been available to the forger.[1][3] Archaeologist Bradley T. Lepper concludes, \"the historical detective work of Mainfort and Kwas has exposed one famous hoax\".[15] And Professor in Biblical Studies and Ancient Near Eastern Studies at Johns Hopkins University, Kyle McCarter expresses, \"the Bat Creek stone has no place in the inventory of Hebrew inscriptions from the time of the First Jewish Revolt against Rome\" and \"belongs to the melodrama of American archaeology in the late 19th century\".[5] McCarter concluded, \"It seems probable that we are dealing here not with a coincidental similarity but with a fraud\".[5]",

        "Document description": "The Nebra sky disc (German: Himmelsscheibe von Nebra, pronounced [ˈhɪml̩sˌʃaɪbə fɔn ˈneːbra]) is a bronze disc of around 30 cm (12 in) diameter and a weight of 2.2 kg (4.9 lb), having a blue-green patina and inlaid with gold symbols.[1][2] These symbols are interpreted generally as the Sun or full moon, a lunar crescent, and stars (including a cluster of seven stars, axiomatically interpreted as the Pleiades[3][4]).\n\nTwo golden arcs along the sides are thought to mark the angle between the solstices. Another arc at the bottom with internal parallel lines is usually interpreted as a solar boat with numerous oars,[5] though some authors have also suggested that it may represent a rainbow,[6] the Aurora Borealis,[7] a comet,[8] or a sickle.[9]\n\nThe disc was found buried on the Mittelberg hill near Nebra in Germany.[10] It is dated by archaeologists to c. 1800–1600 BCE and attributed to the Early Bronze Age Unetice culture.[11][12] Various scientific analyses of the disc, the items found with the disc, and the find spot have confirmed the Early Bronze Age dating.[13][14][15]\n\nThe Nebra sky disc features the oldest concrete depiction of astronomical phenomena known from anywhere in the world.[1][16][13] In June 2013, it was included in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register and termed \"one of the most important archaeological finds of the twentieth century.\"[17]",
        "Document claims": "There were some initial suspicions that the disc might be an archaeological forgery. Peter Schauer of the University of Regensburg, Germany, argued in 2005 that the Nebra disc was a fake and that he could prove that the patina of the disc could have been created with urine, hydrochloric acid, and a blow torch within a short amount of time. He had to admit in court that he had never held the disc in his own hands, unlike the eighteen scientists who had examined the disc.[70] Scientific analyses of the patina (or corrosion layer) have confirmed its authenticity.[21]\n\nRichard Harrison, professor of European prehistory at the University of Bristol, stated in a BBC documentary that \"When I first heard about the Nebra Disc I thought it was a joke, indeed I thought it was a forgery\", due to the extraordinary nature of the find, although he had not seen the sky disc at the time. The same documentary presented scientific analyses confirming the authenticity of the disc.[21]\n\nA paper published in 2020 by Rupert Gebhard and Rudiger Krause questioned the Early Bronze Age dating of the Nebra disc and proposed a later Iron Age date instead.[71] A response paper was published in the same year by Ernst Pernicka and colleagues, rejecting the arguments of Gebhard and Krause.[13] Scientific analyses of the disc, the items found with the disc, and the find spot have all confirmed the Early Bronze Age dating.[1][15]",

        "Document description": "The Epistle XIII to Cangrande della Scala (Italian: Epistola XIII a Cangrande della Scala) is a letter of disputed authenticity sent by Dante Alighieri to his patron, Cangrande I della Scala.[1][2]\n\nThe exact date that the letter was written is unknown. The letter was cited by the Italian copyist Andrea Lancia [it] in 1343 and then by the chronicler Filippo Villani around 1400. Some authors have suggested that Jacopo della Lana [it] cited the letter in the 1320s, but this is disputed.[3]\n\nThe letter is divided into three parts: A dedication to Cangrande I della Scala, an accessus or introduction, and an exposition of the Divine Comedy.[3]",
        "Document claims": "The question of whether or not the Epistle is a forgery is controversial among Dante scholars. Scholars such as Henry Ansgar Kelly and Bruno Nardi [it] have argued against its authenticity, whereas scholars such as Francesco Mazzoni [it], Robert Hollander, and Charles Singleton have argued that the document is authentic.[3][5][4] Kelly specifically contends that Dante wrote the dedication but the rest of the letter was written by a \"Pseudo-Dante\".[3] The academics Ralph G. Hall and Madison U. Sowell have suggested that American scholars are more likely to accept the Epistle as authentic while British and Italian scholars are more likely to consider it a forgery.[6]: 144  John Ciardi, who wrote a translation of the Divine Comedy, argued that the framework provided by the letter is useful regardless of its authenticity.[citation needed] The Dante scholar Teodolinda Barolini has described the Epistle as a red herring, writing that \"frankly, I don't care if the Epistle is Dante's or not, since I think the answers that I seek regarding the [Divine Comedy] are to be found in the poem itself.\"[4]: 143 \n\nIn 2019, researchers for the Italian Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione attempted to use machine learning to determine authorship of the Epistle. Their results supported the theory that it was forged, however the authors noted that their study \"should not be considered conclusive\".[7]: 5 ",
